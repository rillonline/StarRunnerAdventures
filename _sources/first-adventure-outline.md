# First Adventure Outline #

 1.  Arrival at Dirty World Station
     * We learn that Dirty World Station is a smugglers' port on the Northern Frontier.
     * We learn that Captain Star Runner is a pantheran.
     * We learn they are tolerated but not embraced.

2.  The Spacers' Lounge
    *  Star goes to the lounge to gather intelligence rather than to
   drink.
     *  The spacers learn the border with the Coalition has been closed.
     *  As most of the smugglers cross the border regularly, there is a
      lot of anger.
	    *  Some of this is directed at Star as they are a Pantheran and
         distrusted if not despised.
    *  Gyllian calls for the spacers to treat Star as one of them
            rather than as the enemy.
    *  She calls on Star to share intelligence with the group
               concerning the Pantheran military.
    *  Star is conflicted and leaves the lounge.
