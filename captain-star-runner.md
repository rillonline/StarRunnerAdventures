# Introducing Book 1: Captain Star Runner #

This is the first book in the series. Originally begun in 2007, it was
completed in 2021. Despite not being finished, it has served as the
anchor for the rest of the series.

The Clouder genetically modifies its workers for particular tasks.
When workers are unsatisfactory for any reason, they are terminated.
Captain Star Runner, a fuchsia-colored Pantheran, is one of these.
Unlike all the others, they escaped to the Northern Frontier and now
they work among human smugglers and traders. When the Coalition, led
by the Clouder closes the border, Captain Star Runner's expertise
becomes vital to the nacent Consortium, a a group of frontier worlds
committed to their independence and economic well being. Along the
way, Star makes friends, enemies and discoveries about themself and
the universe.
