<h1>I Meet with the Czarina<a class="headerlink" href="#i-meet-with-the-czarina" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We arrived at my flat without incident. Josh made himself comfortable
and I got some much needed rest.</p>
<p>In the morning I found Josh sprawled out on my lounge chair enjoying the
view.</p>
<p>“You look comfortable,” I observed.</p>
<p>“this is a much nicer view than I have,” Josh said. “How’s the view on
Dollar Bay Drive?”</p>
<p>“Splendid from the roof garden,” I said. “Learn anything?”</p>
<p>“I cracked the code for the Kearsarge Charlie Dayton affair,” Josh said
without a trace of the work it must have taken to do that in his manner.
All in a day’s work, I supposed.</p>
<p>“And,” I said, acting as if such an accomplishment was a daily
achievement. Perhaps it was. I knew nothing about the hacking, I mean
security, business.</p>
<p>“They were definitely having an affair,” Josh said.</p>
<p>“Was it going well?”</p>
<p>“Sort of,” Josh said. “It was all hot and heavy in the beginning as you
would expect. Dayton was taken aback when Kearsarge told him about the
assassination contract. Mudd was a good mine manager and Dayton did not
want to lose him, but Kearsarge sweet-talked him. Things went a little
sour after the deed was done. Dayton wonders who the  new
manager will be and if he will be kept on. The mine employees, you can’t really call them miners, thought
Dayton should have bought the contract from Kearsarge and nullified it.”</p>
<p>“Could he have done that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Of course. People buy their contracts every day. You know that.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I’m asking,” I said. “I’m wondering how much the
contract was for and could he have raised the money. Obviously, he had
no influence over Kearsarge to withdraw it and pay the penalties.”</p>
<p>“It was a healthy contract,” Josh said, looking the contract up.
“Kearsarge made the contract here in Ptolemy City, but she did not have
the power to cancel it. That’s weird.”</p>
<p>“Not if she was an agent for someone else,” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Let’s go with that,” Josh speculated. “Someone off-world wants Samuel
Mudd dead. His wife is having an affair. It just happens to be Charlie
Dayton. This off-worlder gets Kearsarge to take out the contract and
Mudd gets blasted. It will look like a lover’s quarrel.”</p>
<p>“Then Kearsarge gets bumped off sans contract,” I said.</p>
<p>“Could be the same off-worlder paying but not being particular about the
conventions here regarding contracts. Just hire some muscle.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Posthumous Patty andDagger Dan.”</p>
<p>“Except no conventional weapons were used. Posthumous Patty likes to cut. No, I don’t
think they killed Kearsarge.”</p>
<p>“Have you found out why those two had access to the house?”</p>
<p>“They worked for Mudd,” Josh said. “His stuff is heavily encrypted. I’m
still working on that.”</p>
<p>“Good work.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>So far. It looks like the affair between Kearsarge and Dayton was either
a cover for the assassination or a convenient cover story after the
fact.</p>
<p>“Can you send that information to Blake?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I can use a one-time address. Do you think he will cancel his
trip to the mine?”</p>
<p>Josh typed in the air as he spoke. I never developed the technique to
the extent he has.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “He is also looking for information on Mudd, for example,
why did he take this job? Why didn’t he stay on Fair Haven? Is there a
connection between this mine and the smuggling operation he’s
investigating?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, right,” Josh said distractedly. “I forgot he has more to
learn than just who killed Kearsarge, why, and why are they after you
now.”</p>
<p>I needed to remember Blake was after the bigger picture, the whole
sordid mess. I only needed to fulfill the directive Kearsarge gave me to
earn my fee. And, after all, earning my fee would allow me to afford the
house. I wondered if I would like living there. I would paint the
outside differently. Although breathtaking, I did not want to be
reminded of an alien landscape.</p>
<p>I left Josh on my balcony, assuring him I would be safe traveling to
Shepheard’s Hotel under my own recognizance. Redman had sent me a
message saying he had overslept because of the meds the urgent care
bot had given him. He regretted not making the interview with the
Czarina. He also needed to prep for our interview with Charlie Dayton.</p>
<p>Shepheard’s Hotel is, in many ways, at the core of the Tenderloin and
thus at the center of life in Ptolemy City.</p>
<p>“The hotel is not physically in the center of the dome. That would put
it in the Nile River and the center of Lake Memphis. Instead, it adjoins
the eastern wall so guests and visitors have an unobstructed view of the
Flaming Mountains, range of volcanoes which parallels the Nile and forms
the eastern boundary of the Nile Valley. On its western side, the hotel
has a view of Lake Memphis and the parkland which stretches from the
Ring Road to the lake shore.</p>
<p>Guests can easily get to the Valley of the Kings, the north-south
shopping street which is divided by Lake Memphis, by an open tram which
connects the hotel with the street on either side of the lake. The
conveyance is known locally as Tootles North and Tootles South. Anyone
can use it. You do not have to be registered at the hotel.</p>
<p>I used it to get from Valley of the Kings, a short caravan ride from my
flat to the grand entrance to the hotel.</p>
<p>People say that if you sit in the lobby of Shepheard’s, eventually you
will see everybody in Ptolemy City pass by. I doubt this is literally
true, but it is true in the sense that lots of people cross its great
expanse and you never know who you might see.</p>
<p>I saw Captain Star Runner for the first time in this lobby. Star pranced
across its open floor space, a filmy scarf fluttering all around that
striking fur. I think I just stared that day. I had never seen a
Pantheran before. Most humans have never seen a Pantheran in the flesh.
They are called big cats because of their general resemblance to our
cats, but that description does not capture the self-assuredness with
which Star moves. Star was both predator and dancer that day, stirring a
longing and a passion in me no woman has ever succeeded to come anywhere
close to doing before or since.</p>
<p>Everybody watched Star, tail up, ears pointed forward, whiskers
immaculately groomed, nose quivering, each paw clicking as it touched
the marble floor. I watched breathlessly. Star is fuchsia-colored unlike
every other Pantheran any of us ever see on video. They are
pastel-colored, blue, pink, yellow, orange, even green. Star’s coat is
rich and vibrant.</p>
<p>These thoughts crowded out any questions I might ask The Czarina. When I
reached the Terrace, I sternly told myself to put them away and
concentrate. I scanned the tables, looking. There she was and
thankfully, for my purpose, sitting alone.</p>
<p>I walked over.</p>
<p>“Hello, Czarina,” I said.</p>
<p>Of course The Czarina is not a royal person. She is not even wealthy.
She pretends like many people in Ptolemy City. She wears a tiara on her
head and various pieces of costume jewelry. The bracelets clank when she
moves her arms which is frequent because she gestures when she speaks.
The Czarina is a service worker, writing a regular gossip column online. She
would call it a news column but much of what she writes is invented.
People pay her not to be written about.</p>
<p>“Ronnie Camberwell,” The Czarina exclaimed. “Do sit down. I’ve been
meaning to message you so we could get together and chat about
everything that happened to you while you were away. I was so sorry to
hear about you and Captain Star Runner.”</p>
<p>All of this was said in one breath.</p>
<p>“I’ve come today to talk to you about Kearsarge,” I said, cutting off
her inquiry into my off-planet sojourn. The Czarina had been helpful to
Star in several of Star’s adventures. I hope she would be helpful to me,
too.</p>
<p>“Terrible about her death,” The Czarina said. It was a non-committal
response. What would it take to get her to talk to me? Perhaps I should
have said something about Star Runner.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “You know she asked me to investigate it posthumously.</p>
<p>“Really?” The Czarina said. “I had heard talk of that but you know, I
just thought it was talk.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “it’s real enough.”</p>
<p>The Czarina considered.</p>
<p>“I might be able to help you,” she said, “but you know my services are
not free.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” I said. “Thank you for being direct. It saves time.”</p>
<p>“There is the little matter of my bill here,” The Czarina said. “The
Terrace is a wonderful place to pick up news, but you cannot sit here
for free.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it,” I said, wondering how big a bill it was. I hoped
Kearsarge’s financial institution would honor all my expenses. I would
have to settle Emily Dickinson’s bar tab, too, if I wanted to talk to
him again. I wondered idly if Captain Kidd had a bar tab at the Treasure
Chest. Maybe he would have something else to say if I met him there.</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” I said, reaching to activate the tab pad. I zeroed out her
account which was sizable. I added a little bit so I could order lunch.
My salad and tea arrived promptly. Despite the cost, it lacked imagination
though all the ingredients were fresh.</p>
<p>“So what can you tell me?” I asked when I slipped the plates into the
recycler. Shepheard’s did not employ waiters on the Terrace.</p>
<p>“She was a lady,” The Czarina began, “I mean a real lady, married to a
lord. Did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “I did. Do you know why they came here to the Pharaoh
Star System.”</p>
<p>“The obvious reason was his position at the mine,” The Czarina spoke
quietly, unlike her greeting and chatter beforehand. “I have gotten the
impression Samuel Mudd knew nothing about mining. He cleared up some
problem or other they were having there, but it had nothing to do with
the mining itself.”</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about the mines. I know they are fairly automated.
What I do know is the Antonius they produce is very valuable. It’s very
rare and it is needed for specialized equipment. I have heard, though I
cannot confirm this, that some of the ore has gone missing.”</p>
<p>“It’s been skimmed off the regular shipments?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” The Czarina said. “I mean an entire ship’s worth has just
disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Taken out of the system without being tracked?”</p>
<p>“That is what I assume.” The Czarina said.</p>
<p>“Is the League of Hypatian Pirates involved?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, that’s the sticking point. If Captain Star Runner were still in the
system, I would have picked them, as the likely captain,
but the League is quite upset they weren’t asked.”</p>
<p>That might be what Captain Kidd knew – that the League was not a
participant in the theft.</p>
<p>“Star would do the run,” I agreed, “but Star’s ride isn’t big enough to
carry ore.”</p>
<p>“It was processed. After it is processed, the pure antonium is in small
bars. Star’s ship could have easily transported it.”</p>
<p>“But not into the coalition,” I objected.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” The Czarina agreed. “If Samuel Mudd was involved, I
suspect it went to Fair Haven.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Charlie Dayton knew about it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not until it was missing,” The Czarina said.</p>
<p>“He was too busy with Kearsarge,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s my guess,” The Czarina said.</p>
<p>I changed tact.</p>
<p>“Know anything about Posthumous Patty orEniable Dan?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Besides they are nasty characters?” The Czarina asked.</p>
<p>“Besides that.”</p>
<p>“Kearsarge,” and here The Czarina frowned, “Kearsarge liked things
rough.”</p>
<p>“Sexually?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but that’s not what I’m trying to say. I mean she liked living
rough.”</p>
<p>“going to the River District, for example,” I said.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” The Czarina said. “Trying to fit in with the pirates.”</p>
<p>“Did she?”</p>
<p>“Not really. They’re smarter than that. They know a fraud when they see
one. But I think Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan were playing some sort
of a long con on her, but I can’t tell you how it worked or if it
worked.”</p>
<p>“And part of the con was acting as her buddies when she hung out with
the pirates,” I said.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” The Czarina said. “I don’t know she did that.”</p>
<p>“I can probably check that out,” I said.</p>
<p>I needed to ask The Czarina about the messages. Did I dare tell her
about the one I received?</p>
<p>I tried to remember what Star told me. Then I remembered how The Czarina
helped during one very difficult incident. It unmasked her somehow, but
Star held it close.</p>
<p>I leaned over the table and spoke very softly. “Kearsarge received death
threats. I don’t know from whom. I’m trying to find out. Now I have
received a threat. Whoever is sending them wants me to quit
investigating. Have you heard anything about messages from outside the
Pharaoh Star System?”</p>
<p>The Czarina was surprised and dismayed.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, Ronnie, this sounds so serious.”</p>
<p>“It is serious,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t like handling this sort of information,” The Czarina said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, “but I have to know. I need to stop this.”</p>
<p>“Of course you do,” The Czarina said. “I am for women taking care of
themselves. I always had to take care of myself. Now let me think.”</p>
<p>I let her think, swallowing the last of my now cold tea.</p>
<p>“I heard Kearsarge mention it once,” she said. “She accused her husband
right here on the Terrace. He denied it, of course. I can’t say anything
more.”</p>
<p>“That’s helpful,” I said, though at the moment I wasn’t sure how.</p>
<p>“By the way, do you know what pressure was put on Emily Dickinson to
come back here to assassinate Samuel Mudd?”</p>
<p>“is that why he came back?” The Czarina asked. “You are full of juicy
tidbits today, Ronnie. I knew I should talk to you.”</p>
<p>“That is what he said,” I said. “I have to talk to him again. I think
it’s all related somehow.”</p>
<p>“Well,” The Czarina said, “the way he is drinking, do it soon. I can’t
imagine he’ll last much longer at this rate.”</p>
<p>“That bad?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That bad,” The Czarina confirmed. “It’s really a shame.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I said.</p>
<p>As I got up to leave The Czarina asked, “Is Captain Star Runner coming
back to Hypatia?”</p>
<p>“Not as far as I know,” I said. “Star’s working on a big project a long
ways from here.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me about it?” The Czarina asked.</p>
<p>“Afraid not,” I said, “it’s confidential.”</p>
<p>It was a long complicated story and I did not want to discuss it with
anyone. I’ll let Star tell it if Star wants to tell it. (It is a yet
unpublished tale.)</p>
<p>I had just enough time to make it to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport for
my shuttle ride to the Alexandria Space Station.</p>
<p>12.Â Â  The spaceport is located outside the Ptolemy City dome proper in
an area called the Levant. Sometimes it is referred to as the Tripoli
Spaceport by old time pirates who know the history of the League.
Captain Star Runner mentioned it once, but then Star has access to
databases replete which such information. Right now, I just wanted not
to miss my shuttle.</p>
