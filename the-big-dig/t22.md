# Juliet Shows Us the Missing Artifacts #

* unformatted
Again we all suited up and wended our way through many tunnels in the
underground complex the archaeological workers had started to call The Big
Dig. I lost track of the tunnel branches we took. I knew I was deep
underground as we traveled down several ramps. F=At last, we entered a
small room with several tables.
"This is what we have found so far," Juliet said, pointing to the several
tables filled with small items. "They all date from about seven hundred and
fifty-three years ago. We haven't found any big things, no information
cubes, no way to identify who these people were or where they came from.
But we do know humans were here."
She picked up an item. "Here is a family portrait. The clothes do not tell
us which planet these people were from. They are people clad in the right
clothing for the period."
She picked up another item. "This is a glove. As you can see, it would fit
a human hand."
All the objects were like that. Just every day things that every day people
would use. They fit the time frame. They told us nothing specific. People
would use these items every day to maintain themselves. That was all.
"Any clue about the room with the paintings?" Tamara asked.
"Nothing," Juliet said. Se seemed q;quite dispirited and not willing to
engage Tamara in a conversation about the Big Dig.
We all went back to Tamara's office.
