# Joining Forces #

After my reunion with Josh, we went to find The Czarina. She was 

still safe, but shaken by our experience. We bought her some drab
clothing and brought her with us to the Alexandria Space Station. I
checked with Tara Lee. The security guards at the Aesculapius Medical
Center reported Emily Dickinson was being released from medical care.
They reported no further attempts on his life. Tara Lee instructed them
to accompany Emily Dickinson back to the Alexandria Space Station.

Simon Parge sent me a message declaring he had solved the case:
Dagger Dan and Posthumous Patty were the killers. If they were detained,
all my problems would be solved.

Simon was correct as far as it went, but the why of it remained. Simon
was never interested in the background of a case. He was interested in
the culprits. In this case, it was obvious to me and Tara Lee that
Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan were hired guns.

"I still can't place them on the scene," Tara Lee said. "I've used
face recognition on all the security records for that area I have, but
nothing pops."

"Do you know how he was killed?" I asked.

"I know he died of a mass heart attack," Tara Lee said. "The
doctors say there's nothing to point to a murder."

"So yew can't pursue it?" I asked. This was incredible.

"Nope," Tara Lee said. "Men of his age die of heart attacks all the time. With
no sign of what might have induced it, I can't do anything."

"No indication of heart trouble in his past?" I asked.

"He had some history of heart disease," Tara Lee said. "With that
history, what happened to him is unusual but not impossible."

"Do you think he was murdered?" I asked, wondering if she was
distancing herself from the case to keep her numbers good for the
tourist trade.

"I have to put it down as death by natural causes," Tara Lee
explained. "I have no indications it wasn't based on the physical
evidence. Based on what you've told me and your experience on Over the
Moon, I can't help but think it was a deliberate act that killed him.
But officially, my hands are tied."

"Unofficially?" I asked.

"I'll do everything I can to help you," Tara Lee said. "I think he
was killed and I don't like the idea of anybody getting away with that
on my patch."

With Tara Lee's investigation at an official end, Josh and I were
free to leave the Alexandria Space Station. There was no reason for us
to stay here anymore.

Tara Lee was able to give us access to the staff canteen where we
waited for Emily Dickinson's arrival. I wanted to talk with him about
our experience and hear what he had to say.

"So am I still under house arrest?" he grumbled when he joined us
at the table in the canteen.

"They're trying to keep you alive," The Czarina informed him. "You
could be a little grateful to us for saving your life." She had met
Emily Dickinson at the gate and shephered him to where we were sitting.

"Can't say if I think that's a good thing or not," Emily Dickinson
groused.

"Stay out of the Nefertiti Bar and your life might be worth
living," The Czarina said.

"Ain't no business in the Pharaoh Star System who would hire me,"
Emily Dickinson said. "A man's got to eat, Czarina."

"And a woman,, too," The Czarina said, "but you don't see me
moaning and groaning about it, do you?"

"You're stronger than I am, always have been, always will be,"
Emily Dickinson said. His compliment both surprised and pleased The
Czarina.

I looked at them both. Neither was young. I wondered what would
become of them.

"I can hire you for at least this case," I heard myself say. "That
would give you a little money."

"I don't need charity, Ronnie," Emily Dickinson said.

"It's not charity," I said. "I think you can bring some expertise
to this investigation. You know some of the background and you know how
theRiverDistrict  operates."

Emily Dickinson considered.

"So you want me to be one of the good guys," he said.

"I don't know if I'm one of the good guys. I'm being paid by
Kearsarge just as you were. Is she one of the good guys?"

"Hardly," Emily Dickinson said. "I take your point. OK, Ronnie.
I'll accept your offer even if I do think it is motivated by pity."

"More like desperation," I thought.It had already popped into my mind
that Captain
Star Runner would have wanted me to look after you. Star would have done
so. It was true but that did not make it relevant. I wondered if it was
my real reason. How much could Emily Dickinson enhance the
investigation.

"I'm worried about us all," I began. "Three of us have had
attempts on our lives. I don't know how safe The Czarina is. I'm trying
to develop a plan to keep us all safe and at the same time find out why
we are at risk and who is behind all of this."

"I can make sure your place is secure," Josh offered, turning to
me. "Could The Czarina stay with you for a bit?"

I hesitated.

The Czarina covered my hand with hers. "I know it's an imposition,
dear," she said. "It's only temporary. I'm sure you will solve this
mystery soon and I can go back to my life. I know the Womyn's Coop has a
guest policy. I would be happy to sign it. Should we take it week by
week?"

The Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority did have such a
document. It allowed the womyn living there to have cohabitants move in,
especially male ones, but also gave them a legal way of having them
removed. This kept the cooperative primarily peopled with womyn.

I took a deep breath. Even a week sounded like an amazingly long
time. I just wanted to be left alone.

"Thanks, Czarina. That sounds like an excellent way to handle
things."

"I'll be at Shepheard's most of the time," The Czarina added.

Captain Star Runner would not like anything bad to happen to The
Czarina either. By proxy, it seemed, I was carrying out Star's wishes.
Was this really a good idea?

"I can have the same policy at my place," Josh told Emily
Dickinson. "And no drinking either," he added.

"You're a tough man," Emily Dickinson grumbled, "but I suppose
you're right. I can use all the help I can get right now."

"So that's settled," I said.

"Yes, sweetie," The Czarina said brightly. "Now you can get onto
your work."

these endearments were going to drive mecrazy.

"OK then," I said. "Let's get on with our work."

I quickly laid out my ideas:

1. Adam Worth owned the Mark Antony Mines. The "Board" was a
fiction.

   He wanted to inflate the price of antonium in order to make a killing in the market.

2. He arranged, through a contact on Fair Haven, for Sam Mudd to come
to the mines to make that happen.

3. Sam Mudd used Jean Jacques Roseau to ship the antonium through
the Aesculapius Medical Center, probably giving Roseau access to some of
the antonium for medical research or equipment or whatever. In turn,
Roseau picked up the antonium and brought it to Over the Moon where it
was shipped out to Fair Haven and the smuggling routes into the
Coalition. With a corner on the antonium market, the smugglers could
charge whatever they wanted for the precious metal.

4. The Fair Haven crowd grew restless for some reason. They wanted
Mudd out of the picture. Kearsarge was only a pawn who officially hired
Emily Dickinson to execute the assassination contract.

"That sounds pretty good," Emily Dickinson said. "That is how the Fair
Haven crowd would work."

"But Blake Redman told me Kearsarge's marriage to Sam Mudd was a lesser
royal family making itself more powerful by marrying a ruling family," I
said.

"Probably so," Emily Dickinson said. "The Benders have been in power a
long time. The Yorks would want to infiltrate that family for sure. This
gambit brings them a lot of power on the interstellar playing field. It
might have been too juicy to reject. Now that both Kearsarge and Mudd
are dead, that alliance is broken."

"Would they have wanted to break it?" Josh asked. "I'm totally ignorant
of this kind of family politics, but if the Bender family wanted to keep
out of the smuggling trade, they might accept the sacrifice of one of
their lesser lords for the well-being of the whole family."

"May be," Emily Dickinson said. "It has happened before. The Crowned
Prince may just have looked the other way when Mudd went down. But, if
it is in his family's interests, he may also use it as an excuse to go
after the Yorks. It can play either way."

"Is it relevant to our case?" I asked.

Emily Dickinson thought about it for a time.

"Probably not," he said, "if Adam Worth is the instigator of all this
and the one who profits the most. You can probably leave the Fair Haven
crowd to its own devices."

"But I heard Posthumous Patty was going to Fair Haven," The Czarina
said.

"Probably so," Emily Dickinson said. "Worth may still be in tight with
the York family. He'll break that contact if they can't deliver on their
agreement to dribble his antonium into the Solar League. He'll find
someone else to scoop up his antonium and work for him more
effectively."

"So you think fingering Worth as our master mind is plausible?" I asked.

"The Napoleon of Crime?" Emily Dickinson laughed. "For sure. Old Adam is
hardly squeaky clean as he pretends. I knew him when."

"So not only being an assassin the York family could blackmail," I said,
"you have the goods on Worth."

"That's about right," Emily Dickinson said. "I was willing to leave
sleeping dogs lie but apparently Adam is not."

"Do you think Adam has overstepped?" The Czarina asked. She had been
quiet the whole time, listening attentively to everything I said.

"He's always been ruthless with his competitors," Emily Dickinson said,
"but he has not gone after regular folks as a rule."

"So what has changed?" Josh asked. He was following the discussion with
great interest which surprised me. Josh was so involved with his neural
net technologies that what went on in the real world always seemed
secondary to him. BUt his life had been threatened in the real world.
There were no second chances here if you died.

"I think Kearsarge changed everything," Emily Dickinson said. "She got
Ronnie here involved and that is a problem for him. Ronnie doesn't get
paid unless she finds out who is behind Kearsarge's killing. Simon Parge
may think fingering Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan is enough. Perhaps
it is for her to earn her fee, but Ronnie knows that's not the whole story.
Besides, she knows it won't put her in the clear so far as Adam is
concerned. She'll be watching him, knowing he's "not as clean as he
pretends. That makes her, and all of us, very dangerous to him."

"Because he values his reputation," The Czarina said. "He doesn't see
himself as a bad person. He is just a businessman and he wants to be
acclaimed as a great civic leader and example of what the freedom in the
Pharaoh Star System can do."

"So he's on a crusade against the Pantherans," Josh said.

"I think that's a little overblown,"Emily Dickinson said.

"But it is essentially true," The Czarina said. "A lot of Solar Leaguers
resent the power the Pantherans hold in the Coalition."

"Perhaps," I said, knowing well how the Pantherans could operate if they
chose, "perhaps we can leave the politics of the western galactic arm
for another day. What do we do to get Adam Worth off our backs?"

Silence greeted me. No one had an idea. Then The Czarina said, "We
need to have some evidence to convince Adam Worth to leave us alone. We
know, but knowing is not enough."

"Can we go public with what we have figured out?" Josh asked.
"Would that be sufficient to put Worth on notice not to mess with us?"

"I think not," Emily Dickinson said. "It just might make us more
expendable. We could seem like people looking to be paid off."

"Really?" Josh asked. "Why would we look that way?"

"The way Worth would spin it is like this," Emily Dickinson said,
counting his points off on his fingers.

  1. Emily Dickinson is a washed up drunk. He needs money to drink.

  2.The Czarina lives on gossip. She needs money to pay her bills."

    Emily Dickinson smiled at The Czarina.

   "Sorry, old girl."

    "It's the truth," The Czarina said. "I can't deny that."

    Emily Dickinson resumed.

"  3. Ronnie is a disappointed lover with no prospects in sight after aving gallivanted around the western galactic arm with one of the big
cats. She has made up this fantastic story to grab attention."

    My first reaction was to object, but Emily Dickinson's point was
	valid. With the glitter gone from my life, a different sort of
	person might just do something crazy to get into the headlines.
	Me, I just wanted to crawl back into my hole.

  "4.," Emily Dickinson continued, "Either Josh's business prospects
  are poor and he wants free advertising or he's stuck on Ronnie and
  goes along with her to score."

    Josh laughed before I could react.

    "Not in a million years would either thing be believable to those
	who know us," he said, "but the general public would assume such
	statements were possible. Ronnie isn't that kind of girl."

    "Then I will go out to dinner with you when this is all over," I said.

    Josh laughed again. "Then maybe all this has been worth it," he
	said. "You know I was just teasing you about a date. It always flusters you."

    "No, I didn't know," I said, "but I'm glad I do now. Shall we get
	back to business?

"Josh, was there anything in the house AI's databases that could help
us."

"I haven't gotten that far into it," Josh said. "After you found the
messages to Jean Jacques Roseau, I stopped looking."

"Then that's where we need to look," I said. "I think we've imposed on
Tara Lee's hospitality quite enough. Perhaps we should go back to
Ptolemy City and start looking there. I also want to talk with Captain
Kidd again. He may know something he's willing to share with us."

"Leave William to me," The Czarina said. "If I invite him to lunch at
the Terrace, he'll come."

I opened my link. "I'll put something on your tab to cover a pleasant
meal with the captain," I said.

"It's been a while," Emily Dickinson said, "but I used to work in
Intelligence for the Solar League Navy. I suspect I can give Josh a
hand."

"I'd appreciate that," Josh said. "I'm good with the nets but the data
-- not so good."

"I'll look, too. Any reason why we shouldn't go to the house on Dollar
Bay Drive and talk with Arthur directly? Is there anything in his
systems that would prohibit that?"

"I'll check to be sure," Josh said.

"I so want to see that house," The Czarina said.

"It will take a little time for you to set things up with Captain Kidd,"
I said, "so you come along with us."

"That will be quite grand," The Czarina said.

I left the others and found Tara Lee in her cramped office.

"Thank you for your hospitality," I said, extending my hand.

Tara Lee grasped it, but did not let go.

"You're leaving us, then?" she asked, still holding onto my hand.

Tara Lee had small hands. I could feel them wrapped around my large one.
It felt very nice.

"Yes," I said a bit awkwardly. It is hard to carry on a nonchalant
conversation when someone is holding your hand like that.

"I wish we had more time," Tara Lee said. "I liked working with you."

But working did not seem the point.

"You must come down to Ptolemy City," I told her. My words surprised us
both.

Tara Lee smiled. It was a beautiful smile.

"I'd like that," she said.

"So would I," I said, feeling big and awkward. I usually felt big and
awkward. That was the thing about being with Captain Star Runner. I
never felt big and awkward. Of course I was much taller than Star, but
Star could stand on hind legs and look me straight in the face. I
remembered his cold nose, bristly whiskers and that rough tongue.

I stopped myself. Here I was suggesting a date with Tara Lee and
thinking of Star Runner. That would never do. Tara Lee was a beautiful
woman and I needed to give her my sole attention.

"I hope it's soon," I said.

Tara Lee squeezed my hand, then let go.

"It will be," she said. "I have time off in a fewweeks."

"Then link up with me," I said "and we'll sort out the details."

Another smile, just for me. I hoped I would not disappoint her. This
could be something very sweet, something very special.

"Thanks for all your help," I said lamely, not knowing how to leave.

"My pleasure," Tara Lee said. There was another smile. She knew I had to
leave, too. "We couldn't pin Redman's murder on anyone, but at least I
know how it went down." She frowned and that was cute, too. "I just wish
I knew how it was done."

"If I find out I'll let you know," I promised. "I've got to go."

"I know," Tara Lee said. And then her link buzzed.

On an impulse, I blew her a kiss as she answered, turned and strode out
of her office, a bit more lightly than usual, or at least I imagined I
walked more lightly.

I would not have anticipated how important that conversation with Tara
Lee would be in the near future. She was, after all, a very special
womyn.
