<h1><span class="section-number">2. </span>Gillian’s First Offer<a class="headerlink" href="#gillian-s-first-offer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>the Pantheran went and what the Pantheran did after leaving
Dirty World Station Gillian never learned, but in time their little
courier ship docked on Pirate’s Cove in the Long John Silver System
far from the Northern Frontier’s border with the Coalition. Gillian
was not surprised that most of the cargo she had requested was quickly
unloaded. For a little ship, it carried a lot of goods. Gillian had
known the Pantheran would not have come to this back water` of a space
station without the opportunity for profit so she had been certain to
make it Captain Star Runner’s wile to come. Exactly what sort of a
return cargo Gillian could offer remained undetermined. As it turned
out, it was who rather than what, but that circumstance has yet to
unfold in this little tale.</p>
<p>“There you are, Captain Star Runner,” Gillian said as she entered the
small docking area of the station.</p>
<p>“Your message did not include a rendezvous location,” the Pantheran
replied. “As this is quite a small space station, I thought I would
inquire of anyone I met where you might be found.”</p>
<p>“What an old-fashioned way of locating someone,” Gilliam exclaimed. “I
would not have thought you would consider that as an option.”</p>
<p>“There is little information on this station available,” Star Runner
said. “I want to enhance my references and my only way of doing that
is walking around.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, let’s walk around,” Gillian said. “The occupancy here is
less than optimal so it is unlikely we will be interrupted.”</p>
<p>“Then how does this station continue to operate?” Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s an easy one, Captain,” Gillian replied. “The planet goes
by the name of Treasure Island, an old Earth book is the inspiration
for its name, and it has large cashes of gems and other rare and
valuable minerals and metals. Bit by bit, they are transported from
the planet to the space station and then onto planets where they can
be processed.”</p>
<p>“Which would be coalition planets,” the Pantheran  said.</p>
<p>“For the most part,” Gillian agreed. “We’d like to have those
facilities on the Northern Frontier so we could hold onto more of the
profit, but at the present time we lack investors.”</p>
<p>“And you can’t process any of the raw materials because of the
Interdiction. Investors are skittdish about the Northern Frontier’s
viability.” Star Runner sounded like a financial report since that is
where they had obtained their information about the economic impact of
the interdiction on frontier worlds.</p>
<p>“Not legally,” Gillian agreed. “We have gotten some through. No border
closures are completely effective especially in Space, but our costs
are very high and it is very dangerous for the operators.”</p>
<p>“And that is why you wanted to talk with me,” Star Runner suggested.</p>
<p>“Actually, no,” Gillian said.</p>
<p>The Pantheran did not respond but waited. In fact, Star and their ride
AI were busily conferring, taking in this new information and
projecting, or trying to project, Gillian’s end game. There was now
not enough information to make a reliable estimation of her intent.</p>
<p>“I know you won’t go near the border,” Gillian said.</p>
<p>“You do?” Star queried. They definitely had underestimated Gillian’s
ability to gather information. .</p>
<p>“You may not be aware of this,” Gillian said, opening a fire hatch and
ushering them into a long empty corridor with the only visible hatch at
the far end.. “The Clouder very much wants to apprehend you. There are postings
throughout the Coalition offering a substantial reward for your
return. Your s�o-called crimes are being advertised. Not knowing the
particular events in question, I suspect they are both exaggerated and
invented, but you are described as quite a dangerous outlaw. That is
actually to the good this far out on the frontier but it does make you
vulnerable as a kidnapping opportunity. The Clouder emphasizes that
you are not to be damaged in any way which makes your capture quite
difficult.”</p>
<p>This was new and troubling information. Ride was unable to verify it
immediately, but judged that Gillian straight shooter reputation made
her assessment quite credible.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent your AI an invitation to connect with our Consortium news
service,” Gillian continued. “We hold our fact finding close in order
to vet it properly. So many rumors and misinformation is broadcast on
open channels that I am not completely surprised that you had not
known of your notoriety. There is even a suggestion that you be made
an honorary member of the League of Hypatian Pirates, but they are
such a reactionary bunch that making a non-human even an honorary
member is repugnant to the rank-and-file.”</p>
<p>The fire corridor (for that is whatit was,) communicated with the
other levels of the station via steep staircases referred to as
ladders. The Pantheran navigated up it awkwardly and with great care.
Gillian stopped talking until they finished their climb. She made no
apology for her route. Her goal was complete privacy.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” she said, finally opening a hatch on a spar ton meeting
room. “I thought this might do for us.”</p>
<p>The room smelled stale and was quite chilly. Gillian wrapped herself
in a shawl tossed over a chair suggesting to the Pantheran that she
had been in this room previously and had prepared for the low
temperature. Clearly they were on an unused part of the space
station Gillian had activated for this meeting. She must have
incredible pull or the station had unlimited resources. Star thought
the former was quite likely.</p>
<p>“So you either plan to kidnap me yourself which is why you brought me
here or what you have to say is very private,” Star said aloud,
wondering if Gillian was recording the meeting. By definition, Star
was. Ride had massive amounts of storage for the purpose.</p>
<p>“If I kidnapped you,” Gillian said, “it would not be to turn you in. I
need your help.”</p>
<p>“My help?” Star asked. “How could I possibly help you?”</p>
<p>“You understand Clouder ships, especially Clouder warships.”</p>
<p>Star did not answer. It was true. They had been genetically modified
invite and trained for that particular purpose and that particular
purpose only.</p>
<p>Gillian waited. The Pantheran had not left the room, dismissing her
suggestion out of hand. Perhaps they were consulting with their
onboard AI. The relationship between the genetically modified
Pantheran workers and their AI was still little understood by
outsiders. The only hard and fast rule she knew of was that the
workers would die if they were out-of-range from their AIs for a
considerable length of time. They could not control their own biology
without them. Experts differed on whether this was a byproduct of
their enhancements or a method of control. If the latter, Star had
managed to solve the problem by having their own AI.</p>
<p>“I cannot do that,” Star said.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I will not permit myself to be enslaved.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean? We don’t enslave anyone.”</p>
<p>“Not so. There are enslaved beings on the Northern Frontier.”</p>
<p>“Those worlds are not included in the Consortium.”</p>
<p>You just said the Consortium does not enslave anyone. If I ran a Clouder
ride, I would be enslaved.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I would have to engage with the onboard AI to run the ride. I
would have the Clouder in my mind.”</p>
<p>Gillian considered this.</p>
<p>“So you are saying the vessel’s AI would take you over?”</p>
<p>“Most likely. You just said the Clouder wants me back. The AI would
know this and know me. It would do everything it could to disable me
and return to Clouder control. I am not the star runner you need.”</p>
<p>“You are the only star runner I have access to.”</p>
<p>“I will be leaving,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>They moved quickly. Going up the ladder had been difficult. Gillian
watched in astonishment as the Pantheran jumped from one floor to the
next. Their tail disappeared down the corridor and she heard the hatch
bang shut.</p>
<p>“Station Manager Wu,” she said into her link. “Please do not let
Captain Star Runner leave the station.”</p>
<p>There was a pause before the station manager responded. “They’ve
already pushed off station. It was quite neatly done. We haven’t any
ship that can delay them.”</p>
