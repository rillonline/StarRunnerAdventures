# A Message from Dennis #
Redman
 and I climbed aboard an elephant with several other passengers. Redman gave
his hotel address. He was staying at the Palace Hotel. I gave my flat's
address, but after Redman got off, I alighted at the Interplanetary
Hotel and switched to a gazelle to get me to Dollar Bay Drive by three
o'clock.

It was a long drive out to Torch Lake. I was looking forward to a
restful ride when my link signaled. At last! The message from the
Fungusians arrived.

From The Fungusian Network, Ministry of Networking Protocols, Solar
League Conventions, IRQSWX792, Dennis

To: Investigator Ronnie Camberwell, FKA Detective Ronnie Camberwell, AKA
Veronica Camberwell, etc.

Subject: Your Request... 

We anticipated getting back to you sooner; however, the protocol above
required more investigation than the initial estimates provided.

The messages you inquired about are being
sent from the Terran planet Fair Haven on the Southern Frontier. These
messages can be traced using the attached protocols. We recommend a
professional. We understand you are in contact with Josh Hardy and
Associates. This firm can remove the block for you and make further
inquiries as you wish.

It has been a pleasure to work for you and if we can be of help in the
future, please do not hesitate to contact us.

And that was it.

I forwarded the message to Josh and asked him what he thought of the
memorandum and the attached specifications.

I knew "That particular Dennis wouldn't be around long. It was the
nature of their species. All the Fungusians who occupy that position in
the network would be called Dennis, at least when corresponding with
longer-lived species. I ill just keep on thinking of my contact as Dennis and all will be
well."

"All roads lead to Fair Haven," I thought. Perhaps I will find out if there is any
information left at Kearsarge's house that will help me. I am
beginning to wonder how much longer I  should pursue this case. From
all I hear, the Yorks are not nice people. But then again, Kearsarge
was a York. Perhaps it is the Benders I should be afraid of. After
all, she had one of them killed. I had assumed so. Was something else
possible? Could it be a competitor of the Benders who wanted
to unsettle the Yorks to create a further wedge between them? Oh, I do hope I do not have to go to Fair
Haven."

I definitely needed a sounding board. I would have to find someone
quick. Could Simon Parge or even Blake Redman fill that role?

My link buzzed. A voice call.

"Josh," I said.

"Hey, girl friend," Josh said. "That message was so cool. A Fungusian
who signs his name Dennis. And his attachment was so simple. I've never
seen anything like it before."

"Can you do it?" I asked.

"Do it? I've already done it. I've filed this baby away. The protocol is
simple, secure and no one else will know how to crack it for a while.
You really gave me an edge, Ronnie."

"Now can you trace those messages?"

"Already working on it, girl friend."

"Remember where you got those protocols from," I said.

"I never forget," Josh assured me. "And just think, the Fungusians not
only know who I am, they think I do good work."

"They think you can follow directions." I corrected him.

"Same thing," Josh said and hung up before I could make another
impertinent retort.
