This is the first of many adventures. Start readingCaptain Star Runner's first adventure here.

The Clouder genetically modifies its workers for particular tasks.
When workers are unsatisfactory for any reason, they are terminated.

Unlike all the others, they escaped to the Northern Frontier and now
they work among human smugglers and traders. When the Coalition, led

becomes vital to the nacent Consortium, a a group of frontier worlds
committed to their independence and economic well being. Along the
