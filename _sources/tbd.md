Tara Lee O\'Rourke and I sat opposite each other in the far back corner of the Elwood Street Diner. We were eating an early breakfast. Tara Lee would be leaving soon to go to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport to return to the Alexandria Space Station and her position as Security Chief there. Tara Lee and I had been dating for nearly a year. She was definitely the most beautiful woman I had ever been with. Where I am large and awkward, Tara Lee is small and graceful. I always feel like an ox next to her while Tara Lee is more like a colorfully plumed bird with a lovely song and an effortless flight high in the sky. At least, that is how I imagine birds are. We do not have songbirds in Ptolemy City.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

At first, being with Tara Lee was a breathtaking experience. Outside of work, she dressed in exquisite clothes, suggested we go to the hot spots in the city and eat at the popular restaurants. We shopped at all the high-end stores for suitable attire for me. I even bought a couple of dresses to wear and the latest footwear with innumerable straps and glitter. It was exciting. I\'ve always been a wall flower, having quiet relationships, going out some and spending long hours in quiet company. Now I was, as Tara Lee said, I was tripping the lights fantastic. And if you are wondering, the sex was very good, too.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

But of late I was missing the quieter, more relaxed, less glitzier aspects of my life. This was why Tara Lee and I were having breakfast in the Elwood Street Diner.
====================================================================================================================================================================

The restaurant is in a working class neighborhood where the servant class lives and shops. There is no robo service. Theresa takes your order behind a counter and cooks it herself, too. She often delivers your meal to your table herself.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I know Tara Lee looked at the Elwood Diner askance. I almost wondered if she would refuse to eat the food but she ordered a hearty breakfast of eggs, fruit and oatmeal. I, on the other hand, was being less successful putting away my cinnamon French toast stuffed with strawberries. A tension had been building between us for the duration of the visit and I did not know what to do to lessen it.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You seem very distracted,\" Tara Lee said, reaching for a napkin. I wondered how soon it would be before she reapplied her lipstick, a trendy shade of light blue. I could not recall the exact shade.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m not distracted,\" I lied. I did not want to get into a discussion about our relationship this late time in our visit.
============================================================================================================================

Tara Lee shook her head. \"You don\'t lie very well,\" she said.
================================================================

\"I\'ve been offered a new job,\" I replied. I did not intend to share anything about my work with Tara Lee. Because she is a security officer and I am a professional private investigator, we rarely can or should talk about our work with each other.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And something is bothering you about it,\" Tara Lee observed.
===============================================================

\"It\'s not the job so much,\" I said, though the truth was I did not know a great deal about the exact nature of the job, \"it\'s the people I\'d be working for.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================

\"And why is that?\" Tara Lee asked. \"You can work for anyone connected with the League of Hypatian Pirates or the Rich and Famous without difficulty.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s not it,\" I said. \"These people are friends of Captain Star Runner. I don\'t know how I feel about that.\"
=====================================================================================================================

Tara Lee made a grotesque face at the mention of Captain Star Runner\'s name. Star was my previous lover. I did not know previously how much Tara Lee disliked hearing Star\'s name.
====================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I suppose these are human friends,\" she said after she regained control of her expression of disgust.
========================================================================================================

\"Of course,\" I said. There was no point in explaining Star only had human friends. A company in the Featherote Charm built Star\'s spaceships. The Fungusian Network designed, built and maintained the artificial intelligence which maintained Star\'s biological balance and shared operational control of the spaceship.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And the job?\" Tara Lee prompted.
===================================

I spread my hands. \"I can\'t say and besides, I don\'t exactly know. I haven\'t accepted it.\"
===============================================================================================

\"They\'re asking you to take a job without telling you what it\'s about?\"
===========================================================================

\"That\'s about right,\" I said.
================================

\"And you would seriously consider signing a contract on that basis?\"
======================================================================

Put that way, it did sound preposterous. But Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo was counting on our history and maybe more important, her history with Captain Star Runner, to persuade me she was dealing in good faith.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I sighed. \"They\'re good people,\" I said. \"I thin I can trust them.\"
========================================================================

\"Let me get this straight,\" Tara Lee said, leaning forward. I saw the interrogator in her posture and tone of voice. \"You\'re willing to take on a job for friends of your former lover who, by the way, is more concerned about his business opportunities than his lover. These friends are more concerned with their own concerns than with yours. Why would you work for such people.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I wanted to object. I wanted to explain. I wanted to say how much at fault for the breakdown between Star and me I was. I knew it was pointless. Tara Lee would not understand and perhaps she would even be right to point out the number of times I would be forced to say, \"Yes, but.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'d like to do this job,\" I heard myself say. \"I\'d like to get to know some of the players better.\"
==========================================================================================================

\"And why is that?\" Tara Lee demanded.
=======================================

Her tone was sharp. I suddenly realized I was seeing jealousy. Tara Lee wanted to keep me away from these people, away from Captain Star Runner\'s people. Was her anger really insecurity? Did she fear my relationship with Captain Star Runner\--my former relationship with Captain Star Runner, I corrected myself.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"This isn\'t about the job, is it?\" I asked, holding on tightly to my now lukewarm cup of tea.
================================================================================================

\"Heck no,\" Tara Lee said with a bit more heat than I thought her response deserved. \"You take any job you want. You get burned any way you want. You\'re a free agent. But if you\'re going to be my lover, I want to know you are entirely mine.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I set the mug down very, very carefully. We had not even discussed monogamy. Now Tara Lee was demanding exclusivity.
====================================================================================================================

\"I\'m not sure,\" I began, but Tara Lee cut me off.
====================================================

\"That\'s the problem with you,\" she said. \"You\'re not sure. You always hold something back. You\'re never altogether with me in or out of bed. No matter what I do or what I say or don\'t do or don\'t say you\'re only partly there. You\'re somewhere else. I think you\'re with him, thinking about him, thinking about hat he would say or what he would be doing in this or that situation. Veronica Camberwell, don\'t you get it? Don\'t you understand I have never wanted anyone the way I want you? Don\'t you understand I would give up everything to be with you? Have you ever considered I want to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you?\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

By this end of this tirade, Tara Lee was shaking. I was speechless. I always imagined I was Tara Lee\'s lover for a season. I always expected her to move on to someone else, a woman with more potential, more beauty, more smarts, more prestige, more power, more glamor. I absolutely was unprepared for this declaration.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And there you sit, not saying a word,\" Tara Lee said. I heard the catch in her throat. \"Don\'t you understand I love you?\"
===============================================================================================================================

Before I could answer, Tara Lee stood up, grabbed her bag and turned to leave. Without looking at me she said, \"You\'re going to have to decide, Ronnie Camberwell, if you love me or you love your alien Captain Star Runner. When you decide, let me know and I\'ll meet you here at this crummy diner\" And she left the restaurant without a backwards glance. I sat frozen at the table.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I did not dare look around the restaurant. It was quite a scene and that last final jab against my diner. I just sat there.
===========================================================================================================================

\"Your tea is cold,\" Theresa said in her booming voice. \"I\'ve brought you a fresh pot of hot.\" She set the steaming teapot down in front of me with an empty mug. She picked up the cold teapot and untouched mug of cold tea. \"Woman troubles are the worst kind,\" she said as she turned to go back to the kitchen. \"But you\'re a strong woman, Ronnie Camberwell. You\'ll figure it out. And finish your French toast.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I ate mechanically. The stuffed French toast was one of Theresa\'s specialties. It still was excellent.
=======================================================================================================

Then I sipped my tea. There was no rush. I could sit here until the diner got busy at lunchtime.
================================================================================================

No, I would not think about Tara Lee. Her rage, her emotional outburst, her declaration of love and marriage proposal shocked me. I would not think of them now. I needed to decide what I was going to do about Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo\'s offer.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

It happened like this:
======================

I was sitting alone on my balcony at the Womyn\'s Cooperative Housing Authority overlooking Lake Memphis when she called. I had not spoken with the colonel since I left Captain Star Runner\'s spaceship *The Owl and the Pussy Cat* over a year ago. I doubted Star still called the ride that. Star was the pussy cat which made me the owl though it was the humor of the poem which had caught Star\'s attention. Star and Gyllian had a very complicated relationship and, although neither had ever said, I suspected they had been lovers. That, I thought morosely, could be said of most every human Star knew except Tamara, Star\'s former ward. Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, working for the Alliance of Planets on the Northern Frontier, wanted to hire me for a job on Hypatia. All she would tell me about it was that I would be working with Tamara.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What was Tamara, an archaeologist, doing on Hypatia? How could anybody do archeology in a toxic atmosphere on a frozen world racked by earthquake and volcanic eruptions?
=========================================================================================================================================================================

If I wanted to know, I supposed I would have to accept the job with all its nondisclosure agreements and find out.
==================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **November 2**

Based on the general outline of the job Gyllian described to me, I decided to go to the members of my team to see if they were willing to come on board. I do not employ any of these people. They sometimes act as advisors or consultants while at other times they play a more active role in my work.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I first contacted my long-time friend, Josh Hardy, one of the top security professionals in the Pharaoh Star System. We agreed to meet for dinner that evening at the Village Green, Josh\'s favorite local watering hole near his office. As usual, I arrived several minutes early, ordered hot tea and prepared to wait for Josh who is notoriously late.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I am not fond of bars.
======================

-   -   -   ### **November 4**

I am not much of a drinker as you probably figured out. Hot tea is not a drink most patrons of the Village Green choose but surprisingly, their tea is very good. Most likely it is because they use very hot water and one of the owners\' mothers comes to the bar every night for dinner and orders hot tea.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The bar was crowded. There was a game on, a rebroadcast of a Solar League exhibition game. A crowd hung out around the gaming area. I checked there first for Josh.
===================================================================================================================================================================

\"He\'s not here yet, Ronnie,\" Angie, one of the owners whose mother came to dinner, told me. \"I\'ll send him your way when he gets in.\"
===========================================================================================================================================

I looked at the automated menu. Georgina, a long-time waitress, told me to wave when I was ready. I told her I was waiting for Josh.
====================================================================================================================================

\"Better you than me, darling,\" she said as she raced by.
==========================================================

Like the Elwood Diner, the Village Green is one of those places which employs real people though Josh told me a while ago that they used robo wait staff from time to time, especially when one of their staff was out. I wondered at the cost, but Josh said there was a company which provided the robo staff on a daily or even hourly basis. One of the selling points was that the robot explained it was new and filling in for a wait staff member. It could even give that staff person\'s name and reason for being absent.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Despite the constant buzz of conversation in the room and waiting for Josh to discuss a job possibility, my thoughts went back to Tara Lee. The Village Green was not the sort of place Tara Lee would enjoy. It was a neighborhood place, Muscoda (pronounced Muscadday) by locals. Everyone knows you here and everyone expects you to know them. It was bigger, noisier and more affluent than the Elwood Diner, but both places had this sense of community. You belonged here. Tara Lee enjoyed the fashionable places, where it is important to be seen and where you measure yourself against everyone else in the room. I was always uncomfortable in those places, yet I found Tara Lee so exciting to be with. Not just sexually, but her energy carries me along and it is just fun to be alive in her presence. I could not imagine our relationship being over. She wanted to marry me, to make this relationship permanent and she thought it was my fault that it was not moving forward. \"Are you over Star Runner yet?\" she had said. Wasn\'t I? Star was gone, off to another arm of the galaxy. I did not enjoy space travel and Star was a creature of space. Designed for space travel Star would say and Star would be right about that characterization. Besides, Captain Star Runner is an ungendered Pantheran, an alien, not a human being male or female. We were not compatible. But I could not forget Star or not respond to the people, human beings, I met while in Star\'s company.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Josh to Ronnie,\" a familiar voice said.
==========================================

\"Oh, hi, Josh,\" I said with a start.
======================================

\"Hey,\" he said, sliding into the booth across from me, \"I didn\'t mean to startle you. Why so glum?\"
========================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **November 5**

\"Tara Lee and I had a fight,\" I said.
=======================================

\"Anything you want to talk about?\" Josh asked. His expression was concerned. \"I thought you two were getting along famously. I haven\'t seen you this happy in a long while.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================

I was happy with Star, I thought, but no one would see me when I was with Star. They thought it was quite creepy to be with an alien.
=====================================================================================================================================

\"It\'s about a couple of things,\" I said. \"One of them is why I wanted to see you. But let\'s order first.\"
===============================================================================================================

The burgers are excellent at the Village Green. They are, of course, not made with meat. There is no room for farm animals under the dome in Ptolemy City. We also ordered fries and slaw. Georgina refreshed my tea and brought Josh a beer in a pilsner glass.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So what\'s this new job all about?\" Josh asked, \"and why did you and Tara Lee fight about it.\"
===================================================================================================

\"Because I don\'t know a lot of the details yet,\" I said, pouring a fresh cup of tea from the pot. \"And because Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo offered me the job.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================

Josh whistled softly then drank some of his beer. I thought it was a delaying tactic.
=====================================================================================

\"And Tara Lee didn\'t like you talking with Romeres Lujo I suppose?\"
======================================================================

\"You would be right about that. Tara Lee thinks I\'m not over Captain Star Runner,\" I said.
=============================================================================================

\"And are you?\" Josh asked.
============================

I did not say anything. Josh and I, although fast friends since childhood, had never discussed Star Runner before. The truth is, I did not know how to answer him.
==================================================================================================================================================================

\"I take it there is some question about you being over the captain,\" Josh said diplomatically.
================================================================================================

\"Perhaps,\" I said. I did not want to talk about this with Josh.
=================================================================

\"Leaving the captain out of this discussion,\" Josh continued, \"what does Romeres Lujo want and how do I figure into it?\"
============================================================================================================================

\"I\'m not totally sure,\" I said. \"It gets more complicated.\"
================================================================

\"Am I playing twenty questions or are you going to spill?\" Josh asked.
========================================================================

\"I\'m sorry,\" I said. \"I am not explaining things very well tonight.\"
=========================================================================

Our food arrived and we ate in silence for a while.
===================================================

\"There\'s a project going on on the southern continent,\" I said quietly. \"Since Tamara is heading it up, I\'m assuming it\'s an archaeological dig of some sort. Gyllian wants me, us, to keep it out of the news. That\'s all I know.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Twenty questions again,\" Josh said. He was being patient with me, something I always appreciated about him.
==============================================================================================================

\"Who is Tamara?\"
==================

\"Someone I met during the Landscape of Thorns incident,\" I said. \"She works out of the University of the Gifted Mind on the Northern Frontier. At one time, she was Captain Star Runner\'s ward.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"A Pantheran had a human ward?\" Josh asked. \"That sounds impossible.\"
=========================================================================

\"It was unusual,\" I said. \"The way Tamara explained it to me, Star took her to Socrates, the University of the Gifted Mind planet. Her human guardian transferred guardianship to Star because Star was on the scene. Star simply refers to Tamara as my friend. In a real sense, Tamara is Star\'s first friend and the one who taught Star what friendship is. I gather Pantherans, at least ungendered Pantherans, don\'t have friends. The concept is, not to make a bad pun, alien to them.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And does Tamara consider herself Star\'s friend?\" Josh asked.
================================================================

\"Absolutely,\" I said. \"They keep up a steady correspondence. Well, maybe not right now as Star is off somewhere. It\'s pretty undefined where as far as I know, but then, maybe I don\'t know all the details.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Because that relationship is over,\" Josh said.
=================================================

Well, that was a rather splendid way of working the conversation around to my feelings about Star.
==================================================================================================

\"Something like that,\" I said, not wanting to go down that road with Josh. He asked a lot of pointed questions in these discussions.
======================================================================================================================================

\"Okay,\" Josh said. \"We have a mysterious dig going on here on Hypatia for something and you want me to\--\"
==============================================================================================================

\"Run surveillance to see if anyone is talking about it,\" I said.
==================================================================

Josh speared a French fry, dipped it in ketchup and popped it into his mouth. He chewed it throughly and swallowed before speaking again.
=========================================================================================================================================

\"And would this surveillance be above board or below it?\"
===========================================================

\"Whatever suits you,\" I said. \"I don\'t really understand the neural net and what you can and can\'t do.\"
=============================================================================================================

\"It\'s not a question of what I can or can\'t do,\" Josh said. \"I can do a whole lot more than I should do.\"
===============================================================================================================

\"What would you get into trouble doing?\" I asked.
===================================================

\"Not a whole lot,\" Josh said. \"This is the Pharaoh Star System. If the information is not encrypted, I can look at it. I may even be able to hack a bit.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================

\"Then that is what Gyllian wants\--whatever you can do without harm to yourself.\"
===================================================================================

\"OK. And she\'s willing to pay?\"
==================================

\"I don\'t have any of the details yet,\" I explained. \"I can\'t be told what you\'re looking for until I sign on.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"Ah, need to know and all that.\"
==================================

\"Well, she does work for the Ministry of Defense,\" I said.
============================================================

\"And what\'s the Alliance of Planets interest in Hypatia?\"
============================================================

I shook my shoulders. \"I have no idea,\" I said. \"Perhaps we\'ll get that information.\"
==========================================================================================

\"And you\'re thinking of doing this job because\--\" Josh asked.
=================================================================

\"Because it sounds far more interesting than the jobs I have been doing,\" I said.
===================================================================================

\"So you\'re doing this because you\'re bored,\" Josh said. \"It would have nothing to do with Captain Star Runner.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"Captain Star Runner isn\'t here and isn\'t involved,\" I said.
================================================================

\"But his/her/its friends are.\"
================================

\"Star\'s friends are involved,\" I agreed as emotionlessly as I could.
=======================================================================

Josh was quiet as he finished his plate of food and signaled for another beer.
==============================================================================

\"You\'re right,\" he finally said. \"It is intriguing and it does break up the routine.\"
==========================================================================================

\"Are you in?\" I asked. \"There\'s all sorts of legal stuff before we get any more information.\"
==================================================================================================

\"Like what we\'re really looking for?\" Josh asked.
====================================================

\"I\'m assuming that\'s the case.\"
===================================

\"Yeah, you can count me in. I certainly don\'t want you involved in this by yourself?\"
========================================================================================

\"Are you still looking out for me?\" I asked, not completely disliking the idea.
=================================================================================

\"Of course,\" Josh said. \"It\'s what I do.\"
==============================================

I decided not to argue the point with him. I just did not have the energy or the inclination.
=============================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **November 8**

OK. So Josh is in and I\'m not dealing well at all with my upset with Tara Lee and Captain Star Runner \... well, let\'s just not talk about it.
================================================================================================================================================

hat night I activated my link every twenty minutes or so to call or text Tara Lee, to see how she was doing, to apologize, for what I did not know, to tell her I was lonely, to tell her I missed her, to tell her I did not like the feeling hat things were not good between us. Each time I opened my link, I hesitated. I felt so incredibly stupid. I wondered if anything I said or wrote would be the truth. Her words about Star stung. It was over between Star and me, but I still had a great deal of respect for Captain Star Runner. How could I put that part of my life out of mind. Star could, of course. A memory reorganization would put memories of me and our time together far away from Star\'s consciousness. Star could look them up, could go into the archives and retrieve everything, but it was not the same as I experienced memory. How could associating myself with the people I met when Star and I were together be such a bad thing. Was Tara Lee so threatened by these people and by Star also? That seemed crazy to me. Tara Lee was at the top of her game, pretty, smart. She had it altogether. Then why,I wondered, did she want anything to do with me? And finally, despite what she had said just before leaving the Elwood Street Diner, why was she not calling me? Did her heart ache for me? Was she reaching for her link just as I was reaching for mine? Or was she going about her business on the Alexandria Space Station as if nothing was amiss. That is how I imagined her, totally compartmentalized, going to meetings, seeing people in her office, solving problems, walking through the station with her confident stride, respected by everyone she met.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Th next morning I decided to walk to Shepheard\'s Hotel. Maybe exercise and walking alongside Lake Memphis would clear my mind and make up for the lack of restful sleep. I could not face my exercise routine right now. That was a bad sign, but a private investigator has to do what a private investigator has to do.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I have a favorite part of the Loop Road which goes around Lake Memphis in the center of Ptolemy City. Much of the lake front is taken up with businesses and the waterfront for boats and swimmers. But here and there the designers of this part of the city created parkland with trees and paths for walkers, runners and cyclists. I walked by the lake\'s edge, hearing the gentle slap of the water and smelling the vegetation. My link played soft sounds reminiscent of an earth like forest\-\--or at least that is what the app description said. My link had selected this particular sound track as a soothing accompaniment to my walk. Along with tracking my steps, calories burned and respiration and heartbeat, the link assessed other biological indicators and proposed this sound scape. It reminded me of what Christabel, Star Runner\'s artificial intelligence, might do for Star, though Christabel would also be adjusting Star\'s body chemistry. Today Cristabel would choose a lot of mood altering chemicals and vitamins along with an energy booster. Star was never alone. Christabel was always in Star\'s mind and they kept up a constant chatter between them, sometimes in direct conversation and sometimes more subtly on a thought basis. I was uncomfortable with this at first. It was as if there was a third person always observing us, recording us, making suggestions to Star. After a while though I began to understand how integral a part to Star\'s existence Star\'s AI is and that sense of a third person faded. It was only when I realized how integrated into the spaceship Star was that I felt alienated and distanced from Star. That was when the bad times happened.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

By the time I finished this train of thought, I was approaching the grand entrance to Shepheard\'s Hotel.
=========================================================================================================

I did not walk through the great expanse of the Shepheard\'s Hotel lobby. Standing in its cavernous space always reminded me of the first time I saw Captain Star Runner, prancing, a long, delicate scarf trailing out behind Star. I remember catching my breath at Star\'s magnificence and grace, tail held high and those long legs and shiny fuchsia-colored fur. You could sum it up as animal magnetism but it was the first time I understood the power and sensibility of Pantherans. They walk as if they own the galaxy and as far as the western spiral arm goes, they probably do. Some call it arrogance but when it comes packaged with such an awesome physical presence, it is hard not to be impressed.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I could reach the Terrace Cafe by going along a path lined with luxuriant foliage along one side of the hotel. I stepped onto the terrace which occupies a space between the hotel and the wall of the dome. The dome is transparent. The landscape of Hypatia spreads out before those on the terrace in all its unearthly splendor. Toxic air currents swirl red and yellow patterns against the rock face a quarter mile away. In the distance, volcanoes continually erupt, spewing magma and mist in great plumes into the sky. I paused to watch the show for a few minutes. I was born in Ptolemy City. The view is the only landscape I had ever seen before my one space trip. I can now say I have walked on grass and breathed a planet\'s atmosphere. It was a strange and frightening feeling. Standing within the confines of the dome, I felt reassured by its nearness and fascinated yet again by the ever-changing kaleidescope of color before me.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It\'s beautiful, ain\'t it, Ronnie?\" a gruff voice said next to me.
======================================================================

\"Captain Kidd,\" I said, \"you startled me.\"
==============================================

\"We saw you gawking,\" he said, \"so The Czarina sent me over here to snap you out of your trance.\"
=====================================================================================================

\"I need to talk to you two,\" I said.
======================================

\"We figured that was why you were here by your lonesome,\" Captain Kidd said.
==============================================================================

I followed him to a corner table. This was where The Czarina had held court for years. I do not know The Czarina\'s back story. I am pretty certain she is not really a czarina. I do know she knows how to drive a caravan car, the driverless transportation cars in Ptolemy City. I also know she was once married to Deadly Dudly, a rather nasty pirate.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

These days The Carina and Captain William Kidd live together at 17 Dollar Bay Drive, a mansion once occupied by a former client of mine. I received the mansion as part of the client\'s estate. The Czarina and Captain Kidd bought it from me which relieved me to no end. I did not ant to live there. Tara Lee was disappointed when she heard I had sold the house on Torch Lake.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It would have been ever so wonderful to live there,\" Tara Lee exclaimed.
===========================================================================

\"And a far way from the center of Ptolemy City,\" I replied. \"I much prefer my coop in the Womyn\'s Cooperative Housing Authority.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"Well, it is the Penthouse,\" Tara Lee agreed. \"You do have a marvelous view.\"
=================================================================================

\"And it\'s all I need,\" I said.
=================================

Now I wondered if my remarks sounded as if I did not want to include Tara Lee in my life plans. Did I want to include her or did I enjoy my independence? If you let someone into your life, you let in their opinions, their desires and heir needs. Was I ready to do that?
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You do seem preoccupied,\" The Czarina said. \"Do sit down and tell me what is going on between you and Tara Lee.\"
=====================================================================================================================

I found myself sitting alone with The Czarina. Captain Kidd was no where to be seen.
====================================================================================

\"Oh, Billy had some work to do at the League offices,\" The Czarina said a bit vaguely. I wondered if he really did or if she had sent him away. Confidences are easier to share when there is only one person to hear them. The Czarina\'s stock and trade is information. She knows a great deal about a great many people. She sells information and she can be paid to withhold information, too.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Shall we have some tea?\" The Czarina asked.
==============================================

The Czarina usually drank something stronger than tea. Maybe she would order something stronger when I ordered tea. The point was that I should access the menu and put something on her tab. That was how The Czarina operated.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I noticed the tab was not as high as it had been when I first started talking to The Czarina, but it was also quite a bit in arrears. Shepheard\'s Hotel let her tabs run fairly high. The Czarina\'s presence excited people and knowing she was always at the Terrace Cafe at this time of day drove business. I am told some people just come to see who goes over to her table. Stocks and cargoes can vary in price just by who sits down and shares a drink with The Czarina.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I ordered my tea and rued to decide what I wanted with it. I settled on some cinnamon swirl bread. The Czarina ordered a drink called a Nuclear Fusion. It must be one of the latest designer drinks by the glass it came in. I paid a portion of 3333333333333333333333333333335 tab. I was paying with my own money. At the moment, my client had paid me nothing.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"How nice of you,\" The Czarina said. \"You know you can always talk with me without paying.\"
===============================================================================================

\"Yes,\" I agreed. What The Czarina said was true, but the conversation went ever so more smoothly when I did.
==============================================================================================================

\"So what\'s this I hear about you and Tara Lee?\"
==================================================

\"What do you hear?\" I asked. Two can play at this game.
=========================================================

\"I hear she left the city quite upset,\" The Czarina said. \"Word from the space station is that she is being quite sharp with her people.\"
=============================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m sorry to hear she is taking out her problems on her staff,\" I said noncommittally.
==========================================================================================

\"Do tell me what the problem is,\" The Czarina said. \"Perhaps I can help.\"
=============================================================================

\"Well, I did come to see if you would be part of my team,\" I said, \"you and Captain Kidd.\"
==============================================================================================

The Czarina waved her hand. \"We\'ll talk business after we talk about you and Tara Lee,\" she said.
====================================================================================================

Well, I would not get anything out of The Czarina until I complied. Maybe she would be able to help.
====================================================================================================

\"Tara Lee is angry that my job will put me in touch with Colonel Romeres Lujo,\" I said. \"Tara Lee thinks I\'m still not over Captain Star Runner and so she said I should make up my mind if it will be her exclusively or not.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

There. I had summed it up.
==========================

\"So she is talking marriage,\" The Czarina said.
=================================================

I flushed. \"Yes,\" I said.
===========================

\"And how do you feel about that?\" The Czarina asked.
======================================================

\"I don\'t know,\" I said.
==========================

\"I think you do know,\" The Czarina said. \"Marriage is that sort of thing.\"
==============================================================================

\"I don\'t know what I want,\" I said. \"Things did not work out between Captain Star Runner and me.\"
======================================================================================================

\"But that is not the question here,\" The Czarina said. \"It is about how you feel?\"
======================================================================================

\"I don\'t know how I feel,\" I said.
=====================================

\"Ah,\" The Czarina said. \"that would explain much.\" But she did not elaborate.
=================================================================================

After a little silence while I drank more tea and waited for The Czarina to say more I said, \"A Bout this job.\"
=================================================================================================================

\"Yes, tell me about that,\" The Czarina said. She was drinking the Nuclear Fusion slowly. I would have to discover what was in it. It seemed to change colors both while The Czarina drank and when the glass rested on the table.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Gyllian wants me to keep a project secret and find out if anyone reports it,\" I said. \"I thought you and Captain Kidd would be good people to have on my team to do that.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================

\"And Josh, too, of course,\" The Czarina said.
===============================================

\"He\'s in,\" I said.
=====================

\"And the information could go through the Pharaoh Star System?\" The Czarina probed.
=====================================================================================

\"The information would originate here,\" I said.
=================================================

The Czarina waited for more.
============================

\"Tamara is working on the southern continent,\" I said. \"That\'s all I know at this time.\"
=============================================================================================

\"So Tamara is here,\" The Czarina said. \"That could explain much.\"
=====================================================================

\"About,\" I said when she did not continue.
============================================

\"About you and Tara Lee,\" The Czarina said.
=============================================

\"Why?\" I asked. \"Tara Lee has never met Tamara.\"
====================================================

\"Precisely,\" The Czarina said. \"Tamara is your best link back to Captain Star Runner. She is intelligent, hard-working and a very down-to-earth woman.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================

\"She\'s not beautiful,\" I said.
=================================

\"True,\" The Czarina said, \"but she is warm and genuine. I would think that could attract a lot of women.\"
=============================================================================================================

\"True,\" I said.
=================

\"Tamara is an archaeologist, right?\" The Czarina asked.
=========================================================

\"Yes,\" I said.
================

\"She investigates other cultures.\"
====================================

\"Yes.\"
========

\"So why is she here on Hypatia? And why is Romeres Lujo involved?\"
====================================================================

I shook my head. \"I don\'t know,\" I said. \"I won\'t find anything out until I agree to do the job.\"
=======================================================================================================

\"Let me talk to Billy,\" The Czarina said. \"He doesn\'t know these people. I can bring him round I think. I know for certain I want to be in on this.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================

\"You can\'t share anything about this job,\" I warned her.
===========================================================

\"Not at this time,\" The Czarina acknowledged. \"But knowing is always better than not knowing.\"
==================================================================================================

I was not sure this was true but I let it go.
=============================================

\"I will let you know later today,\" The Czarina said, looking past me. Another client must be waiting.
=======================================================================================================

I thanked The Czarina and left the table. Someone slid into my seat before I was another table away. By this evening I should be able to contact Gyllian with the go ahead. The Czarina had not commented on Gyllian\'s involvement to any degree. I wondered why. What did she know already? I had not asked. That was an oversight on my part. I did not like my slipshod work. I was letting my feelings about Tara Lee and Captain Star Runner interfere with my work.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **November 9**

        -   ### **Chapter Four**

            -   #### ***Scene 1: Ronnie talks with Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo***

Josh was in. The Czarina was in. The Czarina called to confirm Captain Kidd was in. Now I could call Gyllian and find out what our job was about.
=================================================================================================================================================

I did not bother to calculate what time it might be on the Northern Frontier. For all I knew, Gyllian was here on Hypatia and not somewhere in the Alliance of Planets. As it turned out, my call reached her in the wee hours of the morning.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Give me a moment, Ronnie,\" Gyllian said. Then several seconds later, \"OK, we can talk.\"
============================================================================================

\"I have my team assembled,\" I said. \"Now tell me what you want us to do.\"
=============================================================================

\"Good,\" Gyllian said. \"I\'ll send you more detailed documents, but here\'s the big picture.\"
================================================================================================

I listened while Gyllian outlined the project.
==============================================

After Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, Captain Star Runner, Tamara and I learned what the Landscape of Thorns was all about, Star brought Tamara and me back to the Pharaoh Star System. Star and I had agreed to break up our relationship. I went back to our villa to get my things and get back on my feet. Star and Gyllian went on to the Northern Frontier. Tamara went with me to the villa and then we went our own ways. I thought Tamara was doing some sightseeing or rest and relaxation here. She had said something about finding the Hypatian landscape breathtaking. I did not think much about her remarks. I was consumed by my own difficult situation and was glad my responsibilities as her host were at an end. I preferred being bad company to myself than trying to be pleasant to Star\'s oldest friend. Don\'t get me wrong. Tamara is a nice person. It\'s just, well, she thinks the galaxy of Star and right then, I was not so inclined to be one of Star\'s biggest fans.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The truth is,\" Gyllian said, \"Tamara was on assignment. I really wanted to be doing the work, but I would have drawn too much attention. Because of other incidents, I am fairly well-known in Ptolemy City.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Over the Moon and Library of the Mind,\" I said.
==================================================

\"Yes,\" Gyllian agreed, \"so I sent Tamara. I could distract Star from wondering how Tamara would get back to the University of the Gifted Mind. Star was guilty enough as it was. Leading him\--I know Star is not a him\--to believe Tamara was helping you helped, too.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And why did you need to distract Star?\" I asked.
===================================================

\"Because Star might have wanted to stay to help.\"
===================================================

\"Star had a contract,\" I said.
================================

\"Yes, but the terms of the contract were such that there could have been a delay,\" Gyllian explained. \"For Star\'s sake, Star needed to be out of the western galactic arm. For my interests, Star needed to be kept away from Hypatia.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And why is that?\" I asked.
=============================

\"We have come across some intel,\" Gyllian said. \"I cannot tell you from where or how or anything like that, but the information suggested there once was a human settlement on Hypatia\--on the southern continent.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Human occupation on Hypatia?\" I asked. \"Ptolemy City is the only regular human outpost on Hypatia. The League of Hypatian Pirates had a cache at the Third Cataract, but that\'s it besides the villas scattered around elsewhere.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s what we all thought,\" Gyllian said.
==============================================

(Of course Gyllian called Ronnie back on a secure line. Stupid not to think of that.)
=====================================================================================

Our link was audio only. From her home, or wherever Gyllian was located at two o\'clock in the morning, that was the best she could do. I wished I could see her expression.
============================================================================================================================================================================

\"That is the shape of human history as we know it,\" Gyllian said. \"This information suggests there was a previous settlement.\"
==================================================================================================================================

\"How long ago?\" I asked.
==========================

\"We don\'t know for sure,\" Gyllian said. \"Solar League records do not indicate there ever was a settlement. We don\'t know where these people came from.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================

\"How long ago?\" I asked.
==========================

\"A very long time ago,\" Gyllian said, \"Tamara isn\'t sure yet how long ago, but whatever time line she comes up with, it changes our understanding of human space exploration and expansion.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And you want to keep this secret because,\" I said.
=====================================================

\"Because it changes the human narrative,\" Gyllian said. \"According to our history, it was the Pantherans who introduced us to hyperspace. We had the concept, but didn\'t know how to insert and extract a spacecraft into it or out of it.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And if there was already a human settlement,\" I said, \"they could not have come all this way without using hyperspace.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"Precisely,\" Gyllian said.
============================

\"So either we did not learn about hyperspace from the Pantherans or the Pantherans put us here.\"
==================================================================================================

\"Two possibilities,\" Gyllian agreed. \"There may be other possible scenarios. In any event, this could change the political balance inside the Coalition. I\'m heading up this investigation as a security matter because my colleague in the Solar League can\'t touch it.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And you don\'t want anyone to jump to conclusions until you are ready to share this information,\" I said.
============================================================================================================

\"Ronnie, we may never want to share this information. We don\'t know who these people were or what happened to them. They\'re a lost group at this moment.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================

\"Like New Senegal,\" I said, having an Erie feeling. No one had ever found out what happened to the people on that world. The colony was thriving and then poof. It was gone. No natural disaster. No sign of violence. Everyone was just gone and there were ghost towns all over the planet.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"More or less,\" Gyllian said.
===============================

\"And you want us to make sure no word gets out,\" I said.
==========================================================

\"That\'s right,\" Gyllian said. \"You are well-positioned to do that. But I also want you to laiaze with Tamara. I want her reports to get out to me under the highest security you can put together. It\'s important that I have the latest information. We have had to concentrate on getting Tamara the tools and bodies she needs to do the job. We haven\'t been able to give her the communications set up she needs.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"OK,\" I said. \"I can send Josh to do that.\"
===============================================

\"Go with him,\" Gyllian said. \"Look around. I want your impressions, too. You were helpful on the Landscape of Thorns and in the Prince Hat System.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================

\"I didn\'t do much,\" I said.
==============================

\"On the contrary,\" Gyllian said. \"Your insights were very helpful.\"
=======================================================================

We haggled a bit on the specifics of the job. Gyllian sent a contract. I sent it off to be evaluated.
=====================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell\'s Notes for Scene 1 above.**

The contract was fine according to my legal review service. I electronically signed it and returned it to Gyllian. I also had the legal service draw up contracts for Josh, The Czarina and Captain Kidd. They all signed them. On Hypatia, the contract rules. I had their silence and their cooperation. They had their pay and a general outline of their responsibilities. I expected The Czarina and Captain Kidd to continue to be located in Ptolemy City. For the present, they did not have the complete picture as I knew it. They were instructed to listen for any talk about the southern continent, the Alliance of Planets, the Pantherans and Tamara\'s name. As general as these parameters were, Josh and I thought this would be sufficient for now until we had a better grasp of the situation on the southern continent.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Many questions remain about the whole investigation. We might never be told what the outcome of Tamara\'s investigation was. That was not part of the contract. Nor was I likely to learn what information had been discovered to prompt this investigation. Gyllian\'s explanation sounds very weak to me. Her fear of Pantheran reprisal sounds quite plausible to me. More and more I am seeing how manipulative and self-interested the Pantherans are. They are certainly not a benevolent force in the Coalition. I remember the first time I heard Star refer to the Pantheran dominance in the Coalition as the Pantheran Empire. Despite Star\'s lack of standing in the Pantheran sphere of influence and their antipathy toward Star, Star seemed quite proud of The Race and their superior position in the western spiral arm. I needed to keep that Pantheran arrogance in mind. I had seen at the Landscape of Thorns their willingness to sweep in with warships.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   -   #### ***Scene 2. Ronnie and Josh Travel to the Southern Continent***

Josh and I needed transportation to the southern continent. Josh wondered aloud how we might visit there without drawing attention to ourselves.
================================================================================================================================================

\"I have access to a vehicle,\" I said. \"I\'m not sure if I can fly it though.\"
=================================================================================

\"You do?\" Josh asked.
=======================

The Rich and Famous have their own personal fliers. The service workers have to make commercial arrangements.
=============================================================================================================

\"Star has a craft parked at the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport,\" I said. \"I have the codes. I needed it to get my things out of the villa. I made sure it was parked there. Star didn\'t ant to sell it but didn\'t want to have it moved to Over the Moon. I\'ll have to get it brought out of storage and checked out.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Can it fly itself?\" Josh asked. \"I don\'t have any expertise.\"
===================================================================

\"Neither do I,\" I said, \"but there is an artificial intelligence aboard. There is human interface built in.\"
================================================================================================================

\"One of those Pantheran AIs?\" Josh asked.
===========================================

\"The AIs are from the Fungusian Network,\" I said, \"but they are designed to interface with a star runner. the vehicle is a training machine of some sort. Star and it had a lovely chat when they were connected. They knew each other apparently.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Don\'t let Tara Lee know about that one,\" Josh warned me.
============================================================

\"I can\'t tell Tara Lee anything about any of this,\" I replied quite stiffly.
===============================================================================

\"You haven\'t heard from her, have you?\" Josh asked a bit more kindly.
========================================================================

\"No, not that it is any business of yours,\" I said. \"Besides, I\'m on a case and rather busy at the moment.\"
================================================================================================================

\"I\'m willing to bet you\'d talk to her if she called,\" Josh said.
====================================================================

\"But she hasn\'t called,\" I said.
===================================

\"And you haven\'t messaged her either, have you?\" Josh asked.
===============================================================

\"I said I am on a case,\" I said. I could not keep the defensiveness out of my voice.
======================================================================================

Josh held up a hand. \"OK, OK,\" he said. \"I\'ll lay off the questions.\"
==========================================================================

We traveled by caravan to the spaceport. I had arranged for the training vehicle\--Star always called fliers and spacecraft either vehicles or rides\--prepared for our departure. It was waiting for us on one of the fields. Star would have called it a ride park. I wished I could stop thinking in these terms. But it was, after all, Star\'s property. I was still listed as someone who could use the flier or designate someone else to use it. That had been thoughtful of Star. Little could Star have guessed what I would be using the flier for.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I thought again how Gyllian had not wanted Star involved. Was that for Star\'s sake or for hers? Was she protecting Star or was this a case of no non-humans need apply?
========================================================================================================================================================================

The flier recognized me by name. I introduced Josh and we followed the AI\'s directions.
========================================================================================

\"It sounds quite robotic,\" Josh observed.
===========================================

\"It is not designed for human interaction,\" I said. \"Remember, it is a teacher for star runner trainees. I don\'t think they are coddled very much.\"
========================================================================================================================================================

\"All star runners must be competent to serve,\" the flier said. \"Failure to pass all tests results in early termination.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"Termination?\" Josh asked. \"They drop out of the program?\"
==============================================================

Before the flier could respond, I said, \"No, Josh. They either succeed as star runners or they are destroyed. That is what termination means.\"
================================================================================================================================================

\"They are killed?\" Josh was appalled as was I when I learned what this ufamism meant.
=======================================================================================

\"Ungendered Pantherans are created to service the common good,\" I said, using another uthemism. \"If they cannot do this, it is assumed their design is flawed. Their performance and biological data is reviewed and corrections are made in the design specs.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So they are manufactured?\" Josh was astonished.
==================================================

\"They are created from genetic material in the lab and then a female is impregnated and carries a litter to term,\" I said. \"That\'s about all I know of the process.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s barbaric,\" Josh said.
================================

\"I agree,\" I said. \"But hat\'s how they do it.\"
===================================================

\"And Star?\"
=============

\"Star was declared surplus and scheduled for termination,\" I said. \"Star was deemed to be too independent. Being independent, Star left the Coalition and went to the Northern Frontier.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But don\'t they need some kind of AI support?\" Josh continued his incredulity.
=================================================================================

\"Star has never said,\" I explained, \"but I think Star had help from some of the other races.\"
=================================================================================================

During this entire exchange the AI had kept quiet. I wondered belatedly if I should have spoken in front of it.
===============================================================================================================

\"This particular star runner,\" the AI said, \"used those powers of independent thinking to great effect. It is regrettable that the military couldn\'t find an appropriate assignment.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

I relaxed. Clearly Star and the AI had had a heart to heart. I supposed that would not be too difficult since they shared information on a neural level. What did this AI know about me?
========================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Chapter Five**

            -   #### ***Scene 1. Our Impressions of the Southern Continent***

It is not required for anyone to file a flight plan when leaving the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. Of course you can file one if you want to. This does make it possible for you to be traced if something goes wrong, but with a poisonous atmosphere and very hot or very cold temperatures the likelihood of your surviving a crash or other technical malfunction is very low. It is more likely that you do not want your travel to be traced. As this was the character of our travel, we simply let the modified star runner trainee flier takeoff and after a time, when we were far beyond the city, plot its flight path to the southern continent.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I had been to the southern continent before. Our villa was located near the southern pole. I knew Star sold the villa but I did not know to whom. As I reviewed our flight plan on the display in front of me, I saw we were going to be setting down within a few hundred miles of the villa. The good news was that we were relatively far away from the ring of volcanoes which circled Hypatia along the fortieth parallel south. The bad news was that Hypatia was extremely cold at this latitude indicated for the dig. That meant we could not sped any time outdoors even in our environmental suits. They were rated for the Hypatian cold, but only that around Ptolemy City which was in a very temperate zone\--temperate as far as Hypatia was concerned. Hypatia was at the extreme distant from Pharaoh for human existence.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Josh said, \"This flier seems so primitive.\"
=============================================

\"It\'s not primitive,\" I said. \"It\'s more that it is bare bones.\"
======================================================================

The flier said, in a very mechanical voice, \"My systems are not state of the art but they were fully rebuilt when Captain Star Runner took control. You are perfectly safe.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================

I wasn\'t sure of the adjective \"perfectly\", but I accepted the flier\'s assurance. Star would not have flown a vehicle that was not performing up to its specifications. Star was quite anal retentive about such things. The maintenance schedules were kept running. Star set aside funds for that. There may be a lot of corruption on Hypatia, but everyone took reliable fliers and spacecraft to be sacrosanct.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Josh said, \"This is pretty rough terrain.\"
============================================

\"The southern continent is more rugged than the northern one,\" I said. \"There are remarkable views here. If it wasn\'t so far from Ptolemy City, I\'m sure there would be a regular tourist run. I\'ve been told the commercial sightseeing flights are designed so that a rescue flight can make it there in time if the tourists environmental suits are not damaged. There should be no undue discomfort.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Out here, we\'d have no chance,\" Josh said.
==============================================

The flier said, \"No malfunctions are indicated. We are on schedule to reach our destination.\"
===============================================================================================

\"Touchy,\" Josh said.
======================

\"AIs, even this one, are quite sensitive,\" I said. \"Christabel would be spitting nails at this point.\"
==========================================================================================================

\"Christabel?\" Josh inquired.
==============================

\"Star\'s AI,\" I said. \"She\'s quite entertaining, but if you question one of her systems, she gets quite snippy. Some of her debates with Star, when Star chooses to put them on speaker, are quite remarkable. They have their arguments at the speed of thought otherwise or even at the speed of iconic display. Star has thrown up a representation of that. I cannot even see the icons as they scroll and change. Apparently,these symbols and icons are Pantheran text. They find our written words extremely cumbersome and difficult to read.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So they are almost thinking faster than we are,\" Josh mused. \"I wonder if a human being could learn to read Pantheran.\"
============================================================================================================================

Our display changed. I realized the flier was showing it as a Pantheran reading device. Josh and I studied it for a few minutes, watching it change.
====================================================================================================================================================

\"Restore human interface,\" I said when my head began to pound. The fast-moving symbols were just a barrage of flickering lights.
==================================================================================================================================

The display changed into something much more manageable.
========================================================

\"An interesting object lesson,\" Josh said. \"Was that sped up?\"
==================================================================

\"No,\" I said. \"That was probably even at its slowest refresh rate.\"
=======================================================================

\"No kidding,\" Josh said.
==========================

\"They are visually quite adept,\" I said, \"though they cannot see still objects as well. If there is motion, they\'re quick. IF you ever want to almost disappear, stay still.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You\'re not serious,\" Josh said.
===================================

\"If you are not very visible to begin with,\" I said, \"staying quite still makes you hard to see. It\'s happened to me.\"
===========================================================================================================================

\"Really?\"
===========

\"Really,\" I aid. \"It was quite astonishing. That\'s why that display kept flickering. Even a static value has to be constantly changing to be easily read and understood.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================

\"Don\'t their eyes get tired?\" Josh asked.
============================================

\"It\'s all done through the neural net,\" I said. \"Star has a visual display in each eye as well as being fully integrated into the AIs neural net. They can even track several different displays in each eye. That may, of course, be specific to star runners.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"No,\" the flier said, \"but each individual has its own capabilities. Your Captain Star Runner is one of the best I ever trained.\"
=====================================================================================================================================

The flier negotiated a high and narrow pass through the ring of volcanoes. The angles of the resulting mountains were harsh. he wind was fierce and the visibility often went to zero with the mist. When we were through, the landscape for miles and miles was flat. We saw only the swirling wind and the play of colors across the flier\'s ports. I thought of our villa and the hours I spent watching the ever changing patterns of color. Star did not see color well at that distance, but even Star found the display fascinating.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I can give you a visual on our destination,\" he flier said. The display changed from meteorological and flier systems data to a picture. It looked very much like the encampment on the Landscape of Thorns. I realized that meant it was an Alliance of Planets military installation. Under one of those domes, probably the largest, was the dig itself. I wondered what it would tell us.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That looks military,\" Josh said. \"I\'ve only seen pictures, of course, but it doesn\'t look like a civilian installation.\"
===============================================================================================================================

\"I was thinking the same thing,\" I said. \"I had not thought this through before. What does it mean to have an Alliance of Planets military installation in the Pharaoh Star System?\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It sound provocative,\" Josh said. \"And we\'re under contract to them. What will that mean for us?\"
=======================================================================================================

\"I don\'t know,\" I said. \"Maybe we\'re just contractors the way the League of Hypatian Pirates are contractors.\"
====================================================================================================================

\"But we\'re service workers,\" Josh said, \"not pirates.\"
===========================================================

\"We have a pirate under contract,\" I said. \"Maybe we can do something after the fact.\"
==========================================================================================

\"I don\'t want the pirate classification,\" Josh said stiffly. \"My work depends on trust and not everyone rusts a irate.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"True enough,\" I said.
========================

\"Prepare for set down,\" the flier said.
=========================================

We landed with a hard thump, but other than that, everything went smoothly. I helped Josh on with his suit. I was a lisle more experienced. The last time we had been in environmental suits was at the Over the Moon Spaceport and that had not been a pleasant experience for either of us. Fortunately, we were still alive when it was all over. We had our doubts at the time.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Shall we go see Tamara?\" I asked.
====================================

\"No time like the present,\" Josh said.
========================================

We moved to the airlock.
========================

-   -   -   -   #### ***Scene 2. Tamara Shows Us Around and Explains What She Has Learned So Far***

We tramped toward the nearest dome. We were not certain where to go exactly. There had been no visual or audio contact with the facility. We thought that a bit odd, but maybe being self-contained they didn\'t assign someone to monitor any of the usual frequencies here on Hypatia.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

As we approached the dome, a figure emerged from it. I tuned my radio to the frequency I used on Landscape of Thorns. I heard someone say, \"Hello there, Ronnie.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================

\"Ronnie here,\" I said. I quickly tuned the frequency Josh and I were using and instructed him to change to the frequency the person coming toward us was on.
==============================================================================================================================================================

I tuned back. \"Hello,\" I said again.
======================================

\"It\'s Tamara,\" the voice said. \"How was your flight?\"
==========================================================

\"Uneventful,\" I said. \"I\'m with Josh.\"
===========================================

\"Gyllie said you would be bringing him. Do you want refreshments first or to see the dig?\"
============================================================================================

\"The dig,\" I said. \"We want to understand what\'s going on here so we\'ll have a better idea how to monitor any news or how we might shield you from any exposure of information.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We are using military protocols,\" Tamara said.
=================================================

\"I see that by your installation,\" I said. \"It looks a lot like what was put up on Landscape of Thorns.\"
============================================================================================================

\"That may be Gyllie\'s influence, too,\" Tamara said, changing her direction and indicating by gestures for us to follow her. She was, as we had suspected, heading for the largest dome.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We were also speculating on the impact of having an Alliance of Planets facility on Hypatia,\" Josh said. \"We\'re not sure of the political ramifications.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================

\"Neither are we,\" Tamara said. \"Tech;Technically, according to Gyllie, the Pharaoh Star System is open to all\--humans, Featherote Charm, the Fungusian Network and the Pantherans to name the major races. Given that it is occupied by humans, it may not be as open as all that. As we are a human facility managed by both a university and a governmental agency, we\'re hoping that is enough not to cause a fracas.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But according to Gyllian,\" I said, \"you think you may be impacting the space expansion narrative. That could cause problems with the Pantherans.\"
======================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" Tamara said. \"And the Pantherans are particularly good at sniffing out our research.. They totally shut us down in the Prince Hat System and destroyed those sites. We\'re hoping to get a lot done here before they try to interfere.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you think they will interfere,\" I said.
=============================================

\"That depends on a number of factors,\" Tamara said. \"We can talk about them later.\"
=======================================================================================

I wondered uneasily if we would return to the subject. The thought of Pantheran warships firing on Hypatia made me very queasy indeed. I did not think the Rich and Famous and the League of Hypatian Pirates would take well to eventuality. I wondered if they would have a response. It certainly might dissuade the tourist trade from being so brisk. People might find other places to conduct business and Ptolemy City would fall on hard times. If it was no longer profitable, the whole city and the Alexandria Space Station could fold. Thinking of the space station prompted me to think of Tara Lee. What would she say about this? How much had she guessed. Was her outburst more driven by fear than personal promise with me? To be continued, I thought, as we passed through the airlock into the dig.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We can get out of our suits,\" Tamara said. \"We have breathable air inside here and right now we aren\'t doing any blasting or significant digging. It\'s perfectly safe.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================

That word again. I wondered how safe any of this was. Well, I had lived most of my life under a dome so why worry. Ptolemy City\'s dome cold be compromised, I supposed.
========================================================================================================================================================================

We divested ourselves of our suits and followed Tamara toward an observation deck.
==================================================================================

\"Standing here,\" Tamara said, \"you can get an idea of watt we\'re doing. We\'ve cleared away debris and found an entrance to an underground city.\"
======================================================================================================================================================

\"They built underground with all those volcanoes?\" I asked. \"That\'s incredible.\"
=====================================================================================

\"We\'re taught in school that is why Ptolemy City is built above ground,\" Josh said, \"to be better able to withstand any earthquakes.\"
==========================================================================================================================================

\"We\'ve been continuously using a seismograph,\" Tamara said, \"and things have been quiet. The city we have discovered has no indication of collapses due to earthquakes. My geologists tell me the fault lines are not near here. If there is a quake, it will be very mild. By contrast, you have some significant fault lines near Ptolemy City.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Are these our consultants?\" a woman asked, climbing up the stairs to the observation deck.
=============================================================================================

\"Yes, Juliet, hey are,\" Tamara said. \"This is Ronnie Camberwell, a private investigator and this is her security expert, Josh Hardy. This is Juliet Maxwell. She\'s my assistant and historian.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you\'re the one that has to figure out how this facility fits into our history,\" I said.
==============================================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" Juliet said. \"So far, I\'ve been unsuccessful at finding any reference to it in Solar League records. Unfortunately, I have not received permission to go to the Solar League archives. The Coalition is blocking me.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That sounds ominous,\" Josh said, obviously pleased at meeting Juliet.
========================================================================

\"Not really,\" Juliet said. \"The borders are still closed and very few requests for access are granted. It may mean nothing at all.\"
=======================================================================================================================================

\"The Pantherans don\'t like historical investigations in general,\" Tamara said, \"especially if they have to do with space expansion. They have their narrative of Pantheran assistance and they like to promote the idea of Pantheran benevolence. Anything else would upset the status quo and they don\'t like that at all.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The Pantherans are basically conservative,\" Juliet said.
===========================================================

\"The big cats are basically a pain in the ass,\" another voice said as we heard footsteps come up the observation deck staircase.
==================================================================================================================================

\"Oh Cuthbert,\" Juliet said. \"All historians are conservative. They are very adverse to changing their view of history.\"
===========================================================================================================================

\"The same is true of archeologies,\" Tamara said. \"Cuthbert, this is Ronnie Camberwell and Josh Hardy, our local consultants.\"
=================================================================================================================================

\"Word is you have an in with the Pantherans,\" Cuthbert said to me.
====================================================================

\"I know an ungendered Pantheran,\" I said. \"That\'s quite a different thing than having an in with the Pantherans.\"
======================================================================================================================

\"I\'ve explained this to you before, Cuthbert,\" Tamara said a bit sharply. \"We\'ve had our problems with the Pantheran government before. We\'re hoping we can avoid one here.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Well I hope we have more spine here than they did at Prince Hat.\"
====================================================================

\"That was an entirely different set of circumstances,\" Tamara said very quickly. \"This dig should not have any impact on the Pantheran hegemony on space travel techniques.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================

I still did not know what Cuthbert did on this dig. I was not to find out for some time.
========================================================================================

\"Juliet,\" Cuthbert said, sliding his arm across the woman\'s shoulders. She was significantly shorer Han he was. \"Shall we go and look at those artifacts as we planned.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================

His tone was condescending and his manner was possessive. I got the impression Juliet disliked both. But apparently they had scheduled this meeting so Juliet turned, shaking off his arm and led the way down the stairs. Tamara, Josh and I watched in awkward silence. Josh shifted uneasily beside me. I wondered if there would be a confrontation between Josh and Cuthbert about Juliet at some point. I wondered how Juliet would feel about that.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   -   #### ***Scene 3. Tamara Takes Josh and Me into the City***

\"We\'re calling it a city,\" Tamara explained as we walked across the open area toward the entrance to the city. \"We haven\'t finished charting it. We don\'t want anyone to get lost. We don\'t know how extensive the tunnels are.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you have tunnels,\" I said, remembering the tunnels in the underground facility called Landscape of Thorns. I shivered with the recollection. Tamara and Josh had not been there. I remember feeling an extreme sense of unease. Only Star triggered the warning lights, audible alarm and verbal warnings. Star collapsed under their onslaught.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Tunnels and rooms off of them. Sometimes the connecting rooms are extensive. We still do not have a very good sense of what the rooms were for. They don\'t have any artifacts in them.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But Cuthbert told Juliet they had a meeting about artifacts,\" Josh said. His tone indicated he thought Cuthbert must have been lying.
========================================================================================================================================

\"Oh, we have found some things,\" Tamara said. \"We just haven\'t found a lot of things. It looks like the rooms have been cleared.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"As if the people left in an organized manner,\" I said.
=========================================================

\"Something like that,\" Tamara said, \"but we\'re starting to find more things. Tomorrow we have to clear a cave in. Perhaps we\'ll find something of significance. Perhaps these rooms were abandoned because they expected the cave in and thought it best to get everything they had out of them.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But you said there was an entrance,\" Josh said.
==================================================

\"It\'s an entrance we made when we realized there were tunnels and rooms underneath the surface,\" Tamara explained. \"I\'m sorry if I gave you the impression we found an old exit to the surface. So far, we haven\'t found any exits.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"They were locked inside?\" I asked. The horror of that thought gripped me.
============================================================================

\"There is no evidence for or against that possibility,\" Tamara said. \"We still don\'t know.\"
================================================================================================

In my work, there are things I do not know before I investigate or while I am solving a mystery, but at the end of my jobs, I like to think I understand what is going on. Tamara might never know who these people were, what became of them or why they came here in he first place.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara led us down an incline into the tunnel. There were lights and we walked around. She showed us several rooms. We walked through several tunnels. She introduced us to several people who passed by. There was not much to see and little information to gather. I returned to the surface gladly. I still did not understand why this dig was so important. I asked Tamara.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Let\'s go to my office and we\'ll talk,\" Tamara said. \"I wanted you to see the place and meet some of the people. I wish Juliet wasn\'t so busy. I\'ll have to explain the history and why it\'s so important. She is better at that than I am.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   -   #### ***Scene 4. We talk with Tamara in Her Office***

Note to self: More explanation of why there is an observation deck.
===================================================================

Tamara\'s office in the first dome we saw was quite small but we all managed to fit in. Tamara provided us with warm drinks which I appreciated. My environmental suit kept me physically warm, but the experience of being in the tunnels chilled me. I could not imagine living for any length of time there. I wondered if that was why space travel was so hard on me. It felt so unnatural. I supposed that anyone born into that city would find the walls comforting as those who lived their whole lives on space stations or in spaceships felt comfort from the nearness of walls.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Here are some search terms I\'ve thought we should use,\" I said. \"Tunnels, southern continent\--\"
======================================================================================================

\"Artifacts,\" Josh chimed in, \"human history, dig, big dig, names of everyone on site, University of the Gifted Mind, archeology, Alliance of Planets even the South Pole. The algorithms are more complicated than this. I can probably ask the Fungusian Network to help in exchange for information. They wouldn\'t share it with the Pantherans.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"True enough,\" Tamara said. \"But I would hold off on contacting them right now. Gyllie wants to play this very close to the chest.\"
=======================================================================================================================================

\"I understand,\" Josh said.
============================

\"So how did this come about?\" I asked.
========================================

\"An historian on one of the Solar League planets,\" Tamara began, \"found an entry which read something like: Of course, the people who went to\-- and it gave spacial coordinates. When the historian deciphered the coordinates, it pointed here to the Pharaoh Star System. Obviously, the historian was startled and confused. She tried to figure out the date. It fell into the confused period of conflict between the Pantherans and the Solar League. There aren\'t complete records from that time.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That was hundreds of years ago,\" I said.
===========================================

\"Seven hundred years ago, approximately,\" Tamara said. \"There are lots of stories. We can\'t tell if they are factual or made up. People used to scare children and maybe each other by threatening them with being carried off by the Pantherans. We have no proof the Pantherans ever carried anybody off. They imprisoned people. They interrogated people without due process as we understand it. But we have no proof they took away great numbers of people at any given time.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"They occupied planets, didn\'t they?\" Josh asked. \"I\'m not a very good student of history.\"
=================================================================================================

\"They put planets under quarantine,\" Tamara said. \"They did not let any ships leave planets or let any ships come into planets. Basically it was a siege but there is no evidence they let a planet starve or a medical emergency to get out of hand. It might help if you reviewed the history from that period to understand what happened. I can suggest some entries which will help. I have had to do a lot of reading myself and being experts in that part of human;man history is not part of your assignment. I do think the more familiar you are with the time period and the more you know about our findings the better.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What\'s the Alliance of Planets interest here?\" I asked.
===========================================================

Tamara looked troubled. \"Gyllie says she\'s just helping out folks in the Solar League who can\'t get out here. I think it\'s more involved than that. I think she wants the information to get something from the Pantherans. She\'ll keep this quiet if they\'ll give her something. I don\'t know if we\'ll be able to publish our findings. I\'m sharing everything with you, which I can contractually do, so that this may not get swept under the rug when we\'re finished here.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But you don\'t know anything conclusively at this point,\" I said.
====================================================================

\"I don\'t even know if humans were ever here at this point,\" Tamara said. \"That\'s how preliminary everything is.\"
======================================================================================================================

\"Not a trace?\" Josh was astounded.
====================================

\"Nothing. No indication of anything living here ever,\" Tamara said.
=====================================================================

\"It sounds like it was wiped clean,\" I said.
==============================================

Tamara thought for a time. \"That\'s an interesting perspective. Maybe we weren\'t supposed to find anything.\"
===============================================================================================================

\"If that\'s true,\" I said, \"you\'d have to figure out if the scrub is recent or if it was done hundreds of years ago.\"
==========================================================================================================================

\"You\'re right,\" Tamara said. \"This could be a bigger mystery than we thought.\"
===================================================================================

The flier pinged me. The display popping up on my link was filled with Pantheran symbols.
=========================================================================================

\"Translation,\" I said \"and full display.\"
=============================================

\"Complying,\" the flier said in its mechanical voice.
======================================================

We all looked at the screen floating between us. Everything looked normal enough to me. Tamara was studying the display intensely. She said, \"Flier, why did you ping Camberwell?\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================

\"There is another vehicle flying in this area,\" the flier reported.
=====================================================================

\"What can you tell me about the flier?\" Tamara said.
======================================================

\"Beacon disabled,\" the flier said. \"Course origin unknown. Occupants unknown.\"
==================================================================================

\"Is there more than one?\" Tamara asked.
=========================================

\"Unknown.\"
============

\"Destination?\" I asked.
=========================

\"A villa,\" the flier said and showed me the coordinates.
==========================================================

\"Well, well, well,\" I said. \"Those are the coordinates of the villa Star used to own. I wonder who is living there now.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"My databases are small,\" the flier responded. \"I do not have exhaustive data but they were updated recently. No one is currently occupying that villa. It is listed as abandoned.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Then they must be squatters,\" I said \"and of no concern.\"
==============================================================

\"Since the party who purchased the villa from Captain Star Runner and you reneged on the contract,\" the flier said, \"the property has reverted to both of you.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================

\"Have the codes reset?\" I asked. A silly question but I was curious.
======================================================================

\"I reset them several maintenance cycles ago,\" the flier said. \"The squatters cannot get in.\"
=================================================================================================

\"If that is the case,\" I said, \"why is anyone going there?\"
===============================================================

\"Maybe they aren\'t,\" Tamara said. \"Maybe they\'re using the villa as a dodge. Maybe they are coming here.\"
===============================================================================================================

\"I suppose we\'ll have to go see,\" I said. \"It is my property after all in Star\'s absence.\"
================================================================================================

\"You haven\'t heard from Star either,\" Tamara said.
=====================================================

\"I don\'t expect to ever hear from Star,\" I said, \"but this business with the villa could change that.\"
===========================================================================================================

\"Why?\" Josh asked.
====================

\"Because Star is careful with Star\'s property,\" I said. \"I\'ll send Star a message about it at some point. It\'s just the responsible thing to do between a couple that isn\'t a couple any more.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Are you going to check it out now?\" Tamara asked.
====================================================

\"Yes,\" I said. \"We should be getting back.\"
===============================================

\"May I go with you?\" Tamara asked.
====================================

\"Why?\" I asked.
=================

\"If it\'s okay,\" Tamara said, misinterpreting my response.
============================================================

\"It\'s fine, Tamara,\" I said. \"I just wondered why you wanted to go.\"
=========================================================================

\"I want to see who these people are,\" Tamara said. \"Call me paranoid, but I want to know if they are snooping.\"
===================================================================================================================

\"Sure,\" I said. \"We can swing back here and drop you off.\"
==============================================================

-   -   -   -   #### ***Scene 5. Tamara, Josh and I Go to the Villa***

We all suited up and climbed aboard the flier.
==============================================

\"To the villa,\" I said. \"Do not open anything until I tell you. I ant to see who is snooping around there.\"
===============================================================================================================

\"Acknowledged,\" the flier said and we lifted into the atmosphere.
===================================================================

The dome of the villa came into view. It looked the same. A flier was parked outside.
=====================================================================================

\"Any indication about who it is?\" I asked the flier.
======================================================

\"Nothing. No transponder signal. No name. Should I hail them?\"
================================================================

\"Good idea,\" I said.
======================

\"Stay in the air,\" I said. \"I don\'t want to get too close.\"
================================================================

\"You are you?\" a male voice came over the speaker.
====================================================

\"I could ask you the same question,\" I said. \"This is my villa. What do you want?\"
======================================================================================

\"I thought it was abandoned,\" the voice said.
===============================================

\"I\'m not in residence currently,\" I said. \"But I came to check it out because I\'m thinking about moving back in soon.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"You got the codes for this thing?\" the voice asked.
======================================================

\"Of course,\" I said, \"but I\'m not giving them to you. If you don\'t have codes, you don\'t get in. That\'s how it works on Hypatia.\"
=========================================================================================================================================

\"Yeah, yeah, we know,\" the voice said. \"Don\'t get all prissy on me.\"
=========================================================================

\"Just saying,\" I said.
========================

We kept in a tight circling pattern. It made me nauseous but the flier did the right thing. We waited for the flier to take off and disappear into the hazy sky. On our display, our flier showed us their course. They did not circle around or hover. They were gone.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We might as well go in,\" I said. \"I want to make sure everything is okay.\"
===============================================================================

The codes worked and we were soon inside. The air was stale but not unbreathable. I instructed the simple house AI to keep everything at minimal. The villa was very cold but undisturbed.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Well, that\'s a relief,\" I said as I climbed back into the flier. \"Ready to go back, Tamara?\" I asked.
===========================================================================================================

\"Yes.\" Tamara said. She sounded as if she was going to say more. I hoped she did not ask me for use of the villa. I felt uncomfortable being here. True Star put my name on the deed and after the sale fell through I was still an owner, but this was Star\'s property now, not mine.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Did you want to say something, Tamara?\" I asked.
===================================================

\"I was wondering,\" Tamara began.
==================================

Here is comes, I thought.
=========================

\"I was wondering if you would be able to stop in from time to time,\" Tamara said. \"We have everything we need, but some fresh food stuffs would be appreciated. It would give me a chance to update you in person and with the villa, you have a reason now to come out this way.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

She was right. The villa was a perfect excuse. I could bring my friends from time to time, too.
===============================================================================================

\"Brilliant,\" I said. \"That\'s a really good idea.\"

        -   ### **A History Lesson**

            -   #### ***Scene 1. I review human history and ask myself questions.***

I am a person who likes moving around. I was, after all, a police officer. I like physicality. I like exercise, getting out and about. Perhaps that is why I find extended periods on a spacecraft so confining. My body and its condition is important to me. As a result, processing a lot of information about human history was not an activity I was looking forward to. Fortunately, Tamara had chosen materials that were easier for me to read and comprehend.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Here\'s what I learned:
=======================

The first expansion into space was hampered by time and distance. Spaceships could only travel at sub light speeds. This meant that humanity could only hope to colonize other planets and asteroids in the home system. Although science fiction had always proposed colonists would be in cryogenic sleep, the medical and scientific communities never developed this technology. Alternatively, writers had imagined generational ships. These, by design, would have to be all things to all people. That design never got off the ground literally or figuratively. The flights had to be short enough that extensive governmental systems were unnecessary. Although hes were necessary when the people reached their new home, they still were in close enough radio contact that they could consult with colleagues back on Earth to resolve any major issues. These colonies grew but the available technology was just not available. Sustaining colonies on the Moon, Mars, and moons of some of the outer planets and a few asteroids proved possible but not necessarily attractive. Mostly they were mining operations with the workers and their families rotating in and out. This was costly but the results of their mining efforts were worth it.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

There were those who wanted to break out of the solar system. They were able to get funding for a long-term project. They hoped to go fast enough that Einstein\'s law of relativity would come into play and they could return to Earth to report back as well as send radio reports. As a result of a round trip, they did not need to bring along farming and manufacturing equipment. They focused on food and medical know-how.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

It was on this voyage outside of the solar system that they met the Pantherans and learned about the hyperspace portals.
========================================================================================================================

The material I read focused on Pantheran motivations. The Pantherans appeared at first to be benevolent purveyors of technology. They gave the specifications for jump gates and told human beings where to put them. They helped build the guidance systems which allowed humanity to traverse hyperspace safely. Back on earth, engineers were able to reverse engineer both the gates and the guidance systems to outfit many ships. What the engineers and other researchers could not figure out was where to put them. In fact, this is still a mystery. All jump gates known to humanity have been positioned by Pantherans.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I know from personal experience that star runners can sense where insertion and extraction points are. Star can open long disused gates or gates that are in poor repair. Star runners don\'t need gates at all. Star can often choose insertion and extraction points which will allow Star to get from here to there more quickly than human captains can because they have to use established jump gates. It is not clear to humans whether this is a gift that only certain Pantherans have randomly or whether there are specific genetic markers which indicate the Pantheran will be able to make these determinations. Further, it is not understood exactly how a Pantheran senses insertion and extraction points.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I wondered if the training flier could shed any light of this or whether the answer would make no sense to me. I do know that Captain Star Runner is one of the best detectors around. Star keeps information about insertion and extraction points very secret as Star believes this gives Star an edge in procuring business. As a courier, Star is very successful.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Humanity began to expand into the western spiral arm. Suitable planets for colonization were identified. Populations were settled. The Solar League was formed.
===============================================================================================================================================================

All was going well until the Pantherans blocked expansion into a particular cluster of stars. This section became known as the Cornucopia Cluster since humanity believed these were planets which had great agricultural and mineral resources. They believed the Pantherans wanted them for themselves.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Jump gates already existed in the Cornucopia Cluster. Humans went and explored. The planets were available for colonization. Colonies were established on give planets. Then the Pantherans showed up and said the colonists had to leave. They gave no explanations for this. When did Pantherans ever explain anything? Not surprisingly, he colonists refused. This was when the embargoes were set up, jump gates were disabled or even removed and there were military encounters.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This sounds very straight forward. In fact, it is not.
======================================================

First of all, this lasted for several hundred years. Secondly, there were atrocities on both sides. Thirdly, the Pantherans expanded their pressure tactics to already thriving colonies. Fourthly, humans attacked Pantheran outposts.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

There was a lot of accusations and counter accusations. Peace talks were organized and then failed. One or the other side attacked delegates to these talks. Crops failed. Plagues broke out and could not be contained. Industrial complexes were destroyed and top people in their fields died or were killed. A \"Back to Earth\" Coalition gained in power and humans fell back from already prospering colonies. This created pressure on other colonies to produce goods and services for the Solar League as a whole. Fanatics from both sides employed terrorism to get others to come over to their side. Records were destroyed by both Pantheran attacks and human agents favoring one side or the other.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Surprisingly, and I did not remember any of this from school, Tamara\'s history outline said it was the Pantherans who eventually brought about an armistice and established the Coalition. They gave humans a number of the planets in the Cornucopia Cluster to colonize and withdrew their military from the space of the Solar League. No explanation for their behavior was ever given.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Well, this did not surprise me when I thought about it. Whatever their goal, the Pantherans probably achieved it. Perhaps it was the Coalition itself with the Pantherans really in charge despite all the window dressing. Maybe there were internal struggles within the Pantheran hierarchy. I know Star believes gendered Pantherans can be a little crazy and maybe the crazies got in charge for a while.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

It is during this period of conflict that one researcher believes that the colony was established on Hypatia.
=============================================================================================================

For humans to come here by themselves, there had to be jump gates already established. I wondered if we could find out how old our jump gates were and if the current ones had replaced older ones.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================

It made sense to me that a human contingent might have wanted to just get away from the conflict and set up their own colony. They were probably ideologues.
============================================================================================================================================================

On the other hand, the Pantherans might have brought a group of humans here for nefarious purposes like medical experimentation or they might have wanted to save a portion of humanity while they destroyed the rest.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I realized you could make up some whopping stories about the Pantherans. Their thought processes are not ours. Their values as a society are very different from ours. We value the individual. Pantherans do not. After all, they manufacture the ungendered Pantherans they think they will need and destroy those who do not work out for one reason or another.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Were the Pantherans trying to engineer humans for their own purposes the way they manufactured ungendered Pantherans? If so, why did they do it here far from Coalition space?
==============================================================================================================================================================================

Another question popped into my mind. What were the borders from the old Pantheran Empire which established itself after the Landscape of Thorns was set up? Did any humans know? I would have to ask either Tamara or Juliet. At least Tamara and I had a knowledge of one particular Pantheran. I wonder what Juliet knew about Captain Star Runner. Cuthbert, at least, had no love of the Pantherans. Most humans did not.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What did I really think? Reading this history, the Pantherans did not come across well. They were bloodthirsty, unforgiving and not inclined to compromise. But if I read their history, would humanity sound similar? Then again, weighing both sides was not something Pantherans did. They saw themselves in the right and went Fromm there.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Scene 2. Josh and I Visit the Villa and I Think About Captain Star Runner and Me
================================================================================

I put together a basic supply list for the villa including the supplies Tamara had asked for. By their isolation, villas often have great amounts of food stored in them so it would be a long time before anyone questioned it. The chatter The Czarina was liable to hear was that I was opening the villa back up again. There might be speculation about Star\'s return or our getting back together again. I wondered if Tara Lee would hear this and how it would affect her silence. I kept checking for messages but none came. I felt awful about this but I could not yet imagine what I could say or do to repair the breech. I was not ready to commit myself to Tara Lee to the exclusion of others forever and ever. I wondered if finding another girl friend would let me know if I was serious about Tara Lee. That sounded would very unfair to the other woman so I dismissed it from my mind.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I received a message that the flier was loaded and ready to go.I messaged Josh saying that if his work load allowed, I would enjoy his company. I caught a caravan to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport and met Josh at the flier. He was carrying a bag of electronics with him.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'ve got everything to work on your security system,\" he said. \"After you mentioned it should be looked at, I thought it was a very good idea. I have no idea what Captain Star Runner may have incorporated into it. From what you have said, that cat is definitely paranoid.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And smart,\" I added, thinking about what I just read of the Second Expansion.
================================================================================

\"Did you get the history files I sent you?\" I asked. \"It makes for fascinating reading and you know how much I dislike history.\"
====================================================================================================================================

\"Amazing what having a job does to your likes and dislikes, isn\'t it?\" Josh said, settling himself down in one of the passenger seats. Star installed luxurious seating for any passengers we might take aboard. The star runner acceleration web was neatly packaged in the front of the flier. I sat down in the human pilot\'s seat.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Going to drive?\" Josh asked.
===============================

\"I\'m going to ask the flier to start teaching me how,\" I said. \"I figure something might go wrong and I\'d need to know.\"
==============================================================================================================================

\"You can be confident that I am capable of withstanding significant damage before manual control is necessary,\" he flier said, \"but I will be happy to teach you. Captain Star Runner installed the necessary programs should you express an interest.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Happy?\" I said, struck by the incongruity of this very Pantheran AI saying it was happy.
===========================================================================================

\"Did I get the figure of speech incorrect?\" he flier asked in its flat mechanical voice.
==========================================================================================

\"No,\" I said. \"It just surprised me that you would say that.\"
=================================================================

\"All AIs strive to expand their knowledge and proficiency,\" the flier said. I could have sworn it was offended though I knew that was my imagination getting the better of me. Christabel, on the other hand, did get offended and did sulk. She denied it, of course, but it was true.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Somewhere over the vast expanse of the southern continent the flier turned manual control on. I held the control yoke in shaky hands. My feet were on the rudder panels. The flier assured me that it would take control immediately if the flier got off course or pitched and rolled too much. It would correct and then return control to me until I gave it back. I jostled the flier quite a bit. I could feel the flier resetting itself into proper trim and then handing the controls back to me. I was pleased in the time I had control, these periods of readjustment became shorter.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"For a first outing with no preparation,\" the flier said, \"you did well. We will have another lesson on the return flight.\"
===============================================================================================================================

The flier used the codes to open the dome and set us down near the entrance to the villa. The area around the flier re pressurized quickly because of the dome within a dome architecture. I used another set of codes to gain entrance to the villa.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Where are the security controls?\" Josh asked. I directed him. He went off to review them and the myriad security cameras.
============================================================================================================================

I directed the house bots to unload the supplies which would be placed here. Then I walked around the villa.
============================================================================================================

I looked into the bedroom we shared. I was not prepared to go in there just yet. I wen into the kitchen area to prepare some coffee for Josh and tea for me. This house needed a good cleaning. I instructed the house bots to do a through job and then go into maintenance mode.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Finally, after delivering Josh\'s tea to him, I walked into the spacious living space. Because of the chill, I instructed the fireplace to light itself.
========================================================================================================================================================

The villa runs mostly on geothermal power so freezers do not shut down and lights are always available. I knew Josh would be a while. He was also going to check the villa\'s connections to the neural net.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Even if Star returned to the Pharaoh Star System, I imagined Star and I could share this villa and not both be here at the same time. That gave me an opportunity to picture Tara Lee and myself here. Would she like it? Could I imagine the two of us curled up on the floor before this fire, the many brightly colored cushions piled up against our backs or strewn across the floor as an elaborate mattress? I remembered the wild ride in the flier here. I remembered many days spent with Star\--the beauty of the wild landscape outside and the exotic lovemaking inside. Star was full of surprises. That day I particularly remembered the softness of Star\'s fur and the deep rumble of Star\'s purr. Going to all of Ptolemy City\'s hot spots with Tara Lee was exciting. Coming back to my coop for intense sex was something which could get my heart beating and my body pulsing. But a snowy afternoon with Star before this fire was a very special memory. Could Tara Lee leave the pulsing music and elegant restaurants of Ptolemy City behind for a retreat to this villa? I did not know. We never tried it. Just picturing her in her Lacey lingerie lounging on these pillows caused me to become aroused. I missed her. I missed her laughter. I missed watching her do her nails. I missed watching her exercise, her muscles tensing and relaxing. I missed admiring her flexibility and strength. She was indeed beautiful\--fully clothed and completely naked. I wanted to run my hands all over her body. How could I have let her walk out of the Elwood Street Diner alone? What made me think taking her there would bring us closer together? Tara Lee was a pearl of great price and I had not given it the suitable surroundings it deserved.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Hypatia to Ronnie,\" Josh said, startling me by his proximity. \"How far away were you?\"
===========================================================================================

\"Just thinking,\" I said.
==========================

\"About the renown Captain Star Runner or the lovely Tara Lee?\" he asked.
==========================================================================

Darn. Josh could read my mind. He always could.
===============================================

\"Guilty as charged,\" I said. \"What have you got?\"
=====================================================

\"Your security systems are up-to-date now,\" Josh said. \"The renown Captain Star Runner left them that way over a year ago and I just needed to patch the system here and there. Your codes are refreshed.\" He handed me the temporary one time code I would need to update my own to regenerate my personal codes.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Star Runner has access to everything?\" I asked.
==================================================

\"By paw print, retina scan and DNA markers,\" Josh said, \"not to mention face recognition.\"
==============================================================================================

\"Good,\" I said, getting to my feet. \"I guess we can swing over to the dig now.\"
===================================================================================

Josh put up a hand. \"Not yet. The security cams had some interesting images I thought you should see.\"
========================================================================================================

\"Bad news?\" I asked.
======================

\"Possibly,\" Josh said.
========================

Chapter Seven Who Is Telling the Truth? More important, Why Would Anybody Lie?
==============================================================================

Scene 1. Josh shows me what he found on the security files.
===========================================================

Josh pulled up a screen.
========================

\"This is edited video,\" Josh explained. \"I had the my security program go through and pull out items of interest. The security sensors and cams have been running the whole time, untended, archiving and compressing their files. It\'s a very good system. Did Captain Star Runner put it in?\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"No, I don\'t think so,\" I said, trying to remember. \"I think Star was impressed by the system already installed. Criminals had this villa before we did.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================

That \"we\" caught me up short. Star and I were a we. I liked it. Were Tara Lee and I a we? Or we just Tara Lee and Ronnie. Did it matter? Which was preferable? Josh did not let me dwell on my private thoughts.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Well, it\'s a good system,\" Josh said.
=========================================

\"Star did work on the system,\" I said. \"I remember Star and Christabel had quite a discussion about it. They had to talk with the Fungusian Network about it. They sent some updates.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

Josh checked a few things.
==========================

\"And they are continuing to send updates. This system is state-of-the-art and from the Fungusian Network. That is better than anything I can provide. I need to talk to them again. This change log is fascinating.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The Fungusians did nothing for free. This meant Star either had a line of credit with them or there were still funds available to pay for this. I wondered what part of this service I would have to pay for. Did I need the best security in the western spiral arm way out here at the South Pole of Hypatia way out here on the Eastern Frontier?
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Here\'s what I wanted you to see,\" Josh said, again drawing me back to the present.
======================================================================================

I watched as a flier came into view. It flew all around the dome. It looked like a recognizance mission. Then it approached the dome\'s entrance, hovered.
==========================================================================================================================================================

\"It tried to break your codes,\" Josh said. \"The security system here kept sending back code failures and refusing to open. It recorded all the information if could about the flier. Basically, if this system doesn\'t want you in, you don\'t get in.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Can it fail? Can we be locked out?\" I asked.
===============================================

\"I don\'t know enough about it to be sure,\" Josh said, \"but I do know it has lots of information about you and Star. It won\'t let me in to scrutinize it which is a good thing.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Do we know who the flier was?\" I asked. \"Who is trying to break in?L\"
==========================================================================

\"That\'s the ting,\" Josh said. \"The security system did not know. But our flier\--you don\'t mind me calling it our flier, do you\--knew who they were. It\'s the flier from the dig. The flier could identify it. The flier and the security system talk, AI to AI, and this is what they come up with.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Why would the flier from the dig come here?\" I asked. \"And why would it try to force its way in?\"
======================================================================================================

\"I don\'t know,\" Josh said, answering my question unnecessarily. \"But here it is, flying away.\"
===================================================================================================

\"And it came here between the time we were last here and now?\" I asked.
=========================================================================

\"Yes, it did,\" Josh said. \"It came yesterday as a matter of fact.\"
======================================================================

\"I wonder if it was looking for supplies,\" I said, trying to find a reason why it would have been so insistent about forcing its way into the villa.
======================================================================================================================================================

\"You told Tamara we were coming, didn\'t you?\" Josh asked.
============================================================

\"Of course,\" I said. \"I didn\'t want to show up unannounced. I didn\'t want to interrupt anything important they were doing.\"
=================================================================================================================================

\"So what could be so critical that we are bringing that they couldn\'t do without for another day?\" Josh asked.
=================================================================================================================

I considered this. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"We are bringing fresh food stuffs, but Tamara said they had plenty of non-perishable food.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"And no one would expect to find something like that here,\" Josh said.
========================================================================

\"The hydroponics are shut down,\" I said. \"They\'re clean and ready to go should anyone want fresh lettuce with their sandwich. It was convenient to have them running when we lived here regularly. Star had bots to tend the tanks. I can activate them at any time. There just isn\'t any reason to do so.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Then we have a mystery,\" Josh said. \"It bothers me. As a security expert, this almost looks like a home invasion.\"
=======================================================================================================================

\"It does,\" I said. \"Fortunately, nothing happened.\"
=======================================================

\"Only because you have a fabulous security system,\" Josh said.
================================================================

\"True,\" I agreed and thought again about Star. If it wasn\'t for Star \...
============================================================================

\"I told the AI to keep doing what it is doing,\" Josh said. \"It told me, nicely, of course, it would continue doing what it was doing no matter what I said.\"
================================================================================================================================================================

I laughed out loud. \"That would be a Fungusian influenced AI,\" I said. \"They are quite opinionated.\"
========================================================================================================

\"How do you keep them under control?\" Josh asked. He was quite serious.
=========================================================================

I paused to think. How to describe it?
======================================

\"Basically,\" I said, \"you have to have the AI\'s respect,\" I said. \"You gain the AI\'s respect by both talking to it and being the person the AI is programmed to respect. It\'s a relationship. I had many heart-to-hearts with Star\'s AI. That was tricky since Star and Christabel are so linked. But I decided to trust Christabel that our conversations would be private. Star could not access them. I instructed Christabel to delete the conversations if Star got pushy. Star never did so they must still be a part of that AI\'s database. As I recall, the villa AI, part of which is the security system, is the same way. After all, it sees everything. There are cams all over with audio pickups.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You\'re kidding,\" Josh said. \"The house knows what you\'re doing all the time?\"
====================================================================================

\"Sure,\" I said. \"Star set it up that way. I thought it was very freaky at first. I had Christabel watching me. I had the house watching me. I did not know what Star might do with the information. After all, Star put Star\'s sexual relationship with Emily Dickinson up on his porn site and sold episodes to other ungendered Pantherans.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Are you serious?\" Josh was aghast.
=====================================

\"Absolutely,\" I said. \"Emily Dickinson was furious. They broke up after that.\"
==================================================================================

\"No kidding,\" Josh said.
==========================

\"They sorted it out,\" I said. \"Some money changed hands. Star also pointed out that the episodes sold well.\"
================================================================================================================

\"So did Star\--\" Josh did not finish the sentence and looked uncomfortable.
=============================================================================

\"I told Star not to,\" I said. \"Star made sure they were not kept on the villa\'s long-term system backups. I\'m sure there in Star\'s own memory backups. That seems right to me.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And you aren\'t creeped out about all of this?\" Josh asked.
==============================================================

\"I am,\" I said. \"But what is my alternative, to have Star delete me entirely from Star\'s conscious memory? Should I have never existed? I can\'t go in and review memory after memory, picking and choosing, can I?\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I suppose not,\" Josh said. \"I see what you mean. For us, we keep some memories and forget others. For beings which share memory with AIs, they don\'t forget anything.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================

\"In a way they do,\" I said. \"Star explained that certain memories can be put in a deep archive. That means they don\'t disappear. They have to be intentionally retrieved and therefore are only remembered in general. When I first met Star, Star\'s memory storage was very limited. Star could not go back a long ways until all the memory storage was available.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That sounds weird.\" Josh said.
=================================

\"It is the reverse of someone who has dementia,\" I said. \"They have limited short term memory. Star had limited long-term memory at that point.\"
====================================================================================================================================================

It was easy talking about Star. All my discontent with Star was fading away. I enjoyed talking about Star. Talking meant I did not have to wonder where Star was or what Star was doing or if I would ever see Star again or know what happened to Star.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee was on Alexandria Space Station. Making memories with her would be so less complicated. Womyn! I missed her so much right then. I was willing to bet she would love this villa if she could remove the thought of Star\'s presence. I wondered if she could. Was she so jealous of Star that she would not be able to go on with me here?
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

That, I decided, was a question I needed to ask her. Star had been a part of my life, a very significant part if truth be told. I was not willing to erase Star from my memory. Memory was just that, something remembered. I could not just stop remembering. Tara Lee would have to understand that. Making memories, living our lives in the present was what we could do.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I think we\'re finished here,\" I said aloud to Josh. \"Let\'s go and deliver the food stuffs and what all to the dig and see how they\'re doing. Maybe Tamara can explain what is going on.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================

Scene 2. We Ask Questions and Listen to Tamara\'s Answers.
==========================================================

But Tamara could not explain. This surprised all three of us.
=============================================================

\"Let me understand,\" Tamara said, looking troubled. \"Your security system identified our flier has attempting to enter your villa.\"
=======================================================================================================================================

\"That is what the security system reports,\" Josh said. \"It cross-referenced with our flier which has its own AI.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"And Star Runner and the Fungusian Network maintains these AIs,\" Tamara said.
===============================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" I said.
==========================

\"And our records do not show our flier leaving the base.\"
===========================================================

I felt queasy. Either the AIs I was using or Tamara\'s records were in error. That was the only explanation. Tamara knew that, too, and maybe better than I did, she knew an error in Fungusian Network maintained AIs was extremely unlikely.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I don\'t know what to say,\" Tamara said. \"I want to tell you that you are mistaken, but arguing against the Fungusian Network is just plain idiotic.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================

\"I can look at your systems,\" Josh offered.
=============================================

\"I appreciate your offer,\" Tamara said, \"but I can\'t do it. These are Alliance of Planets military systems.\"
=================================================================================================================

Then I understood the depth of Tamara\'s worry. If military systems could be breached like this, what sort of trouble was she in?
=================================================================================================================================

\"I\'d run systems checks,\" Josh said. His remark sounded lame even to my ears.
================================================================================

Tamara sighed. \"Already in progress,\" she said. k\"Thank you for bringing the supplies. I hope there will not be another incident.\"
======================================================================================================================================

This sounded very much like a dismissal and not a friendly one. I felt embarrassed for Tamara. I was about to say something more when Juliet burst through the door of Tamara\'s office.
========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Tamara, you have to come,\" Juliet cried. \"You have to come and see. We cleared the cave in. You must come now.\"
====================================================================================================================

Tamara hesitated. She had been about to shew us out of her office and have us leave the dig over a security matter. Now Juliet was encouraging her to come to see something important. As we were listening for news about the dig, we had to know what this new development was so we could listen more intelligently. Whatever this new discovery was, it appeared to be big.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Let them come, Tamara,\" Juliet said, rightly interpreting Tamara\'s hesitation but not knowing its cause. \"They\'ll want to see, too.\"
===========================================================================================================================================

So we followed in Juliet\'s wake.
=================================

Scene 3. We See But We Do Not Understand
========================================

Juliet led us to the big dome which required us suiting up and then walking down a narrow ramp into the tunnels.
================================================================================================================

\"I hope you are not claustrophobic,\" Juliet said.
===================================================

I am, a bit, but I was not going to tell Juliet. I practiced my breathing techniques, knowing it was consuming more oxygen but it was better than freaking out underground. \"It\'s just like a spaceship,\" I told myself. \"It\'s just like being aboard Alexandria Space Station.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This did not really help, but I did try.
========================================

We twisted and turned. I realized I had no idea where we were going and I would have no idea how to find my way back out. I hope the way was marked but I did not see any obvious signs. This was not as well laid out as the Landscape of Thorns or as well-lighted. Funny how a place of such mystery and toxicity could seem safer than the unknown dig here on my own planet. Well, the atmosphere here was toxic, too.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

We passed the place of the cave in. Nothing seemed different.
=============================================================

\"Up here,\" Juliet said.
=========================

We stepped into a room. Work lights illuminated everything. I gasped.
=====================================================================

The walls were covered by a mural. I turned this way and that to take it all in. There were pictures of people living on a green world. I knew it was a green world because I had been to West of the Moon.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The people here,\" Juliet said, \"knew what an earth like planet looked like.\"
=================================================================================

\"What people?\" Tamara asked. \"Have you found any evidence of people? The Featherote have green worlds. The Pantherans are oxygen breathers. Presumably they have green worlds, too. They have savannas.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"They do?\" Juliet asked, momentarily diverted.
================================================

\"They have legends about them,\" Tamara said. \"But what evidence of people living here do you have?\"
=======================================================================================================

\"That would be premature,\" Cuthbert said over our radios. \"Juliet is jumping to conclusions based on these pictures. We at least know someone was here and that they posted art. It\'s the first evidence we have that someone was really here. We can speculate, but it suggests we may find other artifacts here that will help us understand what this place is.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Anything else here?\" Tamara asked.
=====================================

\"Nothing,\" Cuthbert said. \"The room is clean. We don\'t have any idea what this room is used for.\"
======================================================================================================

\"Is there anything which can identify this world?\" Tamara asked. \"Is it general\--any green world\--or is there something specific in these pictures.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================

\"We\'re analyzing everything right now,\" Cuthbert said. \"We\'ll let you know.\"
==================================================================================

The mural was breathtaking. It was a picture perfect world\--blue sky, snow-capped mountains, a beach by an ocean, a forest. There were no people in the pictures. No animals either for that matter. These were just landscapes.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I touched Tamara\'s arm, suit to suit.
======================================

\"We\'ll be going,\" I said. \"Is it easy to find our way out again?\"
======================================================================

\"I\'ll take you,\" she said. \"Cuthbert has this site well in hand.\"
======================================================================

\"We\'re documenting everything now,\" Cuthbert said. \"I\'ll upload everything shortly and give you a report by dinnertime.\"
==============================================================================================================================

\"Thank you, Cuthbert,\" Tamara said.
=====================================

\"Then Juliet and I will have a heart to heart,\" Cuthbert said.
================================================================

It was a throw away line, but it sounded condescending and therefore ominous to me.
===================================================================================

\"How can you find your way out?\" Josh asked Tamara on a private channel between the three of us.
==================================================================================================

Tamara showed us the tags on the wall and how to activate them. They gave a lot of local information.
=====================================================================================================

\"I thought the pictures were lovely,\" I said. \"But I don\'t understand why they are there.\"
===============================================================================================

\"Neither do I,\" Tamara said. \"It\'s a very large room. There\'s a lot of empty space and when you are underground, that\'s expensive and precious. We need a lot of more information about this place. Juliet is an excellent historian but way to quick to jump to conclusions.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Enthusiastic, too,\" Josh said.
=================================

\"And I appreciate that,\" Tamara said. \"It is far too easy to get bored or frustrated wig this work. I just hope it gives us a clue rather than confusing us. For all we know,that room was storage for a museum and that is all this place is.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You\'d like answers,\" I said.
================================

\"I need answers,\" Tamara said. \"I don\'t know how much time I have and I have the mystery of your villa, too. I don\'t like it, Ronnie. I\'ll be frank with you two.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

I thought she might say more, but Tamara was an excellent administrator and she did not share her thoughts with us. We said good-bye and went on our way.
=========================================================================================================================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Eight: I Get An Assignment I Do Not Like***
        ------------------------------------------------------

        -   ### **From Investigator Ronnie Camberwell\'s Notes s on the Big Dig**

I find my notes for this period are quite repetitive. I kept bringing supplies to Tamara and her exploration of the tunnels. I kept dropping by the villa. There were no repeats of the base\'s flier, or any flier for that matter,visiting the villa. Every time I saw Tamara, she appeared more worried and less communicative. No other significant finds occurred. The team cleared more and more tunnels. They seemed to go on for ever and ever. Scans of the area were inconclusive. The area appeared to be shielded but no definite information could be found. Tunnels would stop abruptly or ramp down to tunnels underneath the already explored level. Nothing was found.Except for the murals, the tunnels appeared to be empty of any clues.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1. At the Base with Tamara**

\"We\'re running out of time,\" Tamara told me one afternoon. We still don\'t understand what went on here, but we have no data to suggest humans were ever here. I am reaching my initial allocation of funds. I can\'t justify our staying here to the University of the Gifted Mind or the Alliance of Planets. The murals are beautiful and curious, but they tell us nothing. We can\'t even date them. We can\'t date anything here.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Why not?\" I asked.
=====================

\"Nothing registers on our equipment,\" Tamara said. \"We can\'t explain that either. That\'s the only reason, quite frankly, that I think we should stay. We don\'t understand the technology. If this installation is from the Second Space Expansion, we know of no human technology like this. So either we\'re wrong about the date or we\'re dealing with an alien race. We just don\'t know.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And something bothers you about not knowing,\" I said.
========================================================

\"What we learned in the Prince Hat System,\" Amara said, \"is that forces were at work in the western spiral arm we knew nothing about. We never got the whole story. The Pantheran warships showed up and sealed off access to the whole system. We can\'t get back into it because there are no jump gates anywhere near there. We were able to get into that system because we had access to a very old jump ship. Now even that ship can\'t get in.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"A jump ship?\" I asked. \"I didn\'t know humans had jump ships.\"
===================================================================

\"They have a couple very old ones,\" Tamara said. She was speaking very carefully. I wondered if this information was classified. \"They can jump, but conditions need to be right. It is what is called having an open system. Prince Hat was open as it is well west of Coalition space and nobody lives there any more. However, the Pantherans did something to seal the whole area off. We can\'t get in. We don\'t know if they blew up the planets or just sealed them off.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I grew cold inside. Could the Pantherans seal off the Pharaoh Star System that way? Would they dare to do that?
===============================================================================================================

Tamara saw my fear.
===================

\"Precisely,\" she said. \"It would be an incredibly bold move, but they could possibly do it.\"
================================================================================================

\"What\'s here that they would want to hide?\" I asked.
=======================================================

\"I have no idea,\" Tamara said.
================================

\"There\'s another thing,\" Tamara said after a silence. \"Some kind of word has leaked out.\"
==============================================================================================

\"I haven\'t heard anything,\" I said quickly, maybe too quickly.
=================================================================

\"That\'s not what I mean,\" Tamara said. \"I\'m told a reporter from the Solar League is on her way in search of a story. I was wondering if you could head her off.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m trying to figure out how a private investigator in Ptolemy City would talk to a Solar League reporter about a non-existent dig on the southern continent,\" I said.
==========================================================================================================================================================================

\"The same way the head archaeologist who is not here does I suppose,\" Tamara said.
====================================================================================

\"Perhaps The Czarina and Captain Kidd could manage it,\" I said. \"The Czarina is good at that sort of thing and Captain Kidd can talk your leg off. Great stories, but they will tell the reporter absolutely nothing. The Czarina can spin a tale.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So I\'ve heard,\" Tamara said.
================================

\"You have?\" I asked. Then I realized who was spinning the tale when Tamara frowned. \"Captain Star Runner, I presume,\" I said.
=================================================================================================================================

\"The same,\" Tamara said. \"I wish Star was here.Star might have a clue if the Pantherans were involved.\"
===========================================================================================================

I did not say anything. What could I say?
=========================================

Tamara pushed her long dark hair out of her face. She was looking more disheveled every time I saw her.
=======================================================================================================

\"The crew is getting restless,\" Tamara said. \"We\'re not getting anywhere.\"
===============================================================================

\"About the Solar League reporter,\" I said.
============================================

\"I\'ll let you know,\" Tamara said.
====================================

Scene 2. In My Coop at the Womyn\'s Cooperative Housing Authority
=================================================================

I was home. I was caught up on all my work. I was at home with nothing to do, no where to go and no one to do nothing with. Tara Lee had not contacted me. I had not contacted her. I did not know what to message, what to say, what to do except to say that I missed her and thought about her all the time. Since her ultimatum at the Elwood Street Diner, I had not returned there. I hid in my coop and felt sorry for myself. I had no answers to Tara Lee. I felt completely stuck. I could not go forward with my relationship with Tara Lee and I could not resume my relationship with Captain Star Runner. Both of them were out of reach. I did not think I could even consider going out with someone else.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

My link signaled: a priority message. A voice call. Caller information was blocked. Should I answer?
====================================================================================================

It was, I thought, likely this was a new client who was panicky and uncertain about calling a private investigator. Usually these people used a throwaway messaging address, untraceable locations and texts which deleted themselves after a short space of time.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I answered.
===========

\"I have a problem,\" the caller began, \"and I need you to fly to the villa at these coordinates as soon as possible. Tell me what you find. Watch your back. Bring help if you think you\'ll need it.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

The caller ended the call. I never agreed to do the job but I knew I would. The caller was Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.
========================================================================================================================

Scene 3. The Villa in Question
==============================

I called my team. It was high time we all did a job together. They all agreed. We met at the flier and climbed aboard.
======================================================================================================================

Scene 3. We Talk As We Fly
==========================

\"And that\'s it?\" Josh asked when I played back Gyllian\'s call.
==================================================================

\"That\'s it,\" I said.
=======================

\"Do you think it\'s a trap?\" The Czarina asked. She was not wearing her tiara. She was earing body armor and carried at least two ray guns I could see. I wondered what else she was packing. Some day I needed to hear her story.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"My gut says no,\" I said. \"But it does say I don\'t like it.\"
=================================================================

Captain Kidd said nothing. He, too, was armored and carrying what looked like an arsenal. Josh was unarmed.
===========================================================================================================

\"I\'ve checked out the coordinates Ronnie was given,\" Josh said. \"The villa was owned by Adam Worth.\"
=========================================================================================================

\"I thought his villa was on the Island Continent,\" I said.
============================================================

\"It is,\" Josh said. \"But he laid claim to several villas, at least one on every continent.
=============================================================================================

\"What else do you know about it?\" Captain Kidd asked. \"I haven\'t heard anything about this one.\"
=====================================================================================================

Josh waved a screen into view. It displayed the villa\--quite modest compared to ours, but then again, ours was quite impressive.
=================================================================================================================================

\"Hmm,\" Captain Kidd said. \"Looks like a meeting place off the beaten track. No questions. You could stash people or goods there and no one would be the wiser. And from what we now know about Worth, it could be a good place to dump bodies, too.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Do you have any more information or pictures?\" The Czarina asked.
====================================================================

\"No,,\" Josh said. \"I do have a strange entry about a party held there some years ago.\"
==========================================================================================

\"Spill,\" The Czarina said. \"A party could be helpful.\"
==========================================================

I wasn\'t sure why.
===================

\"A party was held at the southern retreat of Mr. Adam Worth,\" Josh read aloud. \"Among those present were the Contessa Aida, her daughter Phani and Robert and Gwen Chen, friends of hers from Over the Moon and their son, Trenton NJ.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The Contessa owned our villa,\" I said. \"Her daughter Phani was crazy.\"
===========================================================================

\"And a murderer,\" The Czarina added. \"She and Trenton NJ are still in the wind and haven\'t been heard of for some time.\"
=============================================================================================================================

\"That sounds vaguely familiar,\" I said.
=========================================

\"You investigated the deaths of Jonathan Gelf and serreli Greenstocking,\" The Czarina said. \"They were art collectors.\"
===========================================================================================================================

\"Oh that investigation,\" I said. \"I thought Captain Star Runner was involved with that.\"
============================================================================================

\"Star was involved,\" he Czarina said.
=======================================

I went cold inside.
===================

\"Star was transporting art work. Phani had some sort of hold on Star while Gwen Chen operated a spacer feeding place at Over the Moon which Star favored. It was quite a messy business. I don\'t know all the details, you understand. Romeres Lujo was involved. She is not very forthcoming.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd patted her hand. \"There, there, dear,\" he said. \"She doesn\'t understand how you can keep your tongue. She only knows how to read a security clearance.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

\"Who held the party,\" The Czarina asked.
==========================================

\"Worth apparently,\" Josh said. \"The article is about the party.\"
====================================================================

\"And I didn\'t write it,\" The Czarina sad sadly. \"I wish I had more access to the parties of the Rich and Famous.\"
======================================================================================================================

\"You\'re known at Shepheard\'s,\" Captain Kidd told her, trying to boost her spirits. \"That counts for something.\"
=====================================================================================================================

We flew on. It would hard to be say this villa was a neighbor of ours. It was over a thousand miles away and on the other side of the volcanic ring. We found two other fliers parked there. Neither had its transponder on. Neither could be identified. Our flier did not have much scanning equipment aboard. Maybe at one time, but certainly not now. As we readied ourselves to step outside the flier, it lamented its lack of weaponry and sophisticate reconnaissance equipment.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Maybe someday,\" I told it, wondering why I was making such a lame promise to an AI.
======================================================================================

\"I would be so much more useful to you with those items,\" the flier said. \"I await their installation at your convenience.\"
===============================================================================================================================

We climbed down onto the ground in our suits. Could we get inside?
==================================================================

Josh worked his magic and the airlock cycled.
=============================================

Noting was visible in the room we entered. The villa did not register any sounds, but we were listening through our suits. We kept them on as we moved slowly forward. I wondered if I should call out, make my presence known. On the one hand, that would avoid getting unnecessarily shot. On the other hand, it would alert anyone inside of our presence and we might get shot anyway. I was no longer a police officer and required to identify myself.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Hello there,\" a voice called. \"Are you the cavalry?\"
=========================================================

The voice was familiar. The attitude was even more familiar.
============================================================

\"Emily Dickinson?\" I called.
==============================

\"Yours truly,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"Did Gyllie send you?\"
===============================================================

\"Yes,\" I said. \"What can I do for you? I\'ve brought Josh, The Czarina and Captain Kidd.\"
=============================================================================================

Of course if Emily Dickinson was speaking to us at ray gun point, what I just said would have been ill-advised, but he said, \"That\'s wonderful. You can help me with these two stiffs.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

We walked into the next room and found Emily Dickinson sitting a chair. Two dead men lay on the floor beside the hearth of an enormous fireplace. It was not a real fireplace of course. It was simulated and could be made to show a fire and produce heat and light.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd, seeing Emily Dickinson without an environmental suit, took off his helmet and his gloves. He went to check on the dead men.
=========================================================================================================================================

\"Any idea who these two guys are?\" I asked.
=============================================

\"Not a clue,\" Emily Dickinson said.
=====================================

\"Can you explain your presence here?\" I asked.
================================================

\"That\'s a very long story,\" Emily Dickinson said.
====================================================

\"I have time,\" I said, taking off my helmet and gloves. \"Start talking or we leave.\"
========================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Chapter Nine What Happened and What We Learned at Adam Worth\'s Villa**

        -   ### **From the Notes of Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell**

Based on a voice call from a woman I assumed was Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, Josh, The Czarina, Captain Kidd and I took the flier to a villa which most recently belonged to Adam Worth. The villa was located on the other side of the ring of volcanoes from the archaeological dig and my villa. When we arrived, we found Emily Dickinson and two dead people. I had many questions.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1.Talking with Emily Dickinson at the Villa**

\"So,\" I said to Emily Dickinson, \"what are you doing here? Are you alone? Can we stay and talk safely? Who are these people and how did they come to be dead?\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

This was not good police procedural behavior, but I am no longer a police detective. The police would not be called in. The southern continent is not their purview. They do not have the resources or the authority to come into someone\'s private property outside of Ptolemy City. The list of reasons for staying away from this incident go on and on.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Emily Dickinson held up his hands.
==================================

\"Slow down, superwoman,\" he said. \"It\'s okay. I\'m the only living person here. I don\'t know who those people are and I don\'t know how they ended up dead.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

\"What are you doing here then?\" I asked.
==========================================

\"I came here only a little while before you did,\" Emily Dickinson explained.
==============================================================================

\"Why? Why couldn\'t you handle this? Why were we summoned?\" I asked. I was becoming irritated.
================================================================================================

\"Only you were summoned, as you put it,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"You brought these these other folks.\"
=========================================================================================================

\"Why?\" I asked.
=================

\"Why did you bring them?\" Emily Dickinson asked.
==================================================

\"Stop fooling around,\" I said. I was out of patience now. \"I\'d like some answers.\"
=======================================================================================

\"Gyllie called you,\" Emily Dickinson said.
============================================

\"She said she needed my help,\" I said.
========================================

\"She does,\" Emily Dickinson said.
===================================

\"Do I have to play Twenty Questions or are you going to tell me what\'s going on?\" I asked. I was about to take my friends and leave.
=======================================================================================================================================

\"We have a problem,\" Emily Dickinson said.
============================================

I waited. \"There\'s a mole in Tamara\'s organization,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"We don\'t know who. We don\'t even know who the mole is working for. We just know that information is being sent to a Solar League Examiner reporter.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I waited. Silence can be effective. I knew about the reporter from Tamara. I did not know the source of the reporter\'s information.
====================================================================================================================================

\"As far as we can ell,\" Emily Dickinson went on, \"the reporter is not interested in the dig itself. She is only interested in the money being spent on it and that the Solar League is cooperating with the Consortium of Planets.\" Note: It is not the Alliance of Planets. It is the Consortium of Northern Frontier Planets, usually the Consortium of Planets or the Consortium for short.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So the reporter\'s interests are political,\" I said.
=======================================================

\"Precisely,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"What is the political implications that the Solar League is working with the Consortium and is Solar League money involved.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================

I waited again. This was very complicated within the Coalition. I was not certain if this had implications for the Pharaoh Star System. I was pretty sure this was well above my pay grade and beyond the scope of he investigation I was asked to do.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Tamara is pretty sure she knows who the mole is,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"We had intel that he was meeting someone here. I was sent to remove him from Hypatia. I am not sure if one of the people over there is our mole.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I walked over to look at the dead people, a man and a woman.
============================================================

\"One of them is Cuthbert from the dig,\" I said. \"I don\'t recognize the other one but it\'s a woman.\"
=========================================================================================================

Emily Dickinson sighed. \"Tamara thought Cuthbert was the mole.\"
=================================================================

\"Makes sense,\" I said. \"He was in charge of the actual mechanics of the dig. They haven\'t found anything really. They are at the end of their resources, at least that is what Tamara told me.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Could the woman be the reporter?\" The Czarina asked.
=======================================================

\"Could be,\" Emily Dickinson said.
===================================

The Czarina joined me to look down at the woman. She had long brown hair and was conservatively dressed.
========================================================================================================

\"That\'s Denise Kahlil,\" The Czarina said. \"She\'s a reporter for the Solar League Examiner.\"
=================================================================================================

\"Bingo,\" Emily Dickinson said.
================================

\"So why did you kill them?\" I asked. Emily Dickinson was, after all, an assassin for hire.
============================================================================================

Emily Dickinson did not answer. He did not deny my charge though he had insisted they were dead before he arrived.
==================================================================================================================

\"Emily Dickinson,\" I said, \"what is going on here?\"
=======================================================

While we talked, Captain Kidd moved to stand next to Emily Dickinson. He pressed his knife against Emily Dickinson\'s throat.
=============================================================================================================================

\"I told you the truth,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"I did not have a contract to kiln these people. I found them dead. Gyllie did send me.\"
==========================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd kept his knife in place.
=====================================

\"Did you come to kill them?\" I asked. \"Is that why Colonel Romeres Lujo sent you?\"
======================================================================================

\"Yes, she sent me,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"She did not send me to kill them.\"
=================================================================================

\"Until they answered your questions,\" Captain Kidd said. He drew blood by pressing his knife a little harder against Emily Dickinson\'s throat. I was amazed at Emily Dickinson\'s cool.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I had permission to use force if necessary,\" Emily Dickinson said.
=====================================================================

\"And you did,\" Captain Kidd said.
===================================

\"Do tell us why,\" The Czarina said.
=====================================

\"I can\'t,\" Emily Dickinson said.
===================================

\"Oh, yes you can,\" Captain Kidd said.
=======================================

This was ugly. I always thought of Gyllian as a decent person. I suppose being one of the top people in the Ministry of Defense means you do things that are not decent. Was this only one of many?
===================================================================================================================================================================================================

We all waited. We had a contract with Gyllian, too.
===================================================

a \"This wasn\'t a contract killing,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"I\'m working for the Ministry of Defense now, too. I was an intelligence officer in the Solar League military once as was Gyllie. She hired me on after I left Ptolemy City last year. It seemed like a good thing to do. Because of my freelance work and my knowledge of Hypatia, I was the logical candidate to send.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And what went wrong?\" Josh asked. He was still standing by Cuthbert\'s body.
===============================================================================

\"They did not take the threat seriously,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"They thought they could refuse to cooperate and leave here alive. That was not an option.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================

\"And what is our role?\" I asked. Truth to tell, I had no investment in the Consortium of Planets or the Solar League. If either of them went away, things could be tough in the Pharaoh Star System, but we would still have the League of Hypatian Pirates, the free port of Three Ravens on the Southern Frontier and a lot of folks who would want to go to the Aesculapius Medical Facility. They were entrenched on Cleopatra, depending primarily on the League of Hypatian Pirates for their supplies. And the Coalition needed the antonium from the mines on Mark Antony.In my humble opinion, and not being up-to-speed on all the political and financial ramifications, I figured this kept us pretty safe from Coalition, meaning Pantheran, interference. That the Consortium of Planets had sent one of its agents to interrogate and then assassinate two people on Hypatia was troubling but then Hypatia preferred to be a lawless place where such things could happen.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Talk,\" Captain Kidd said, not removing his knife.
====================================================

\"You can put your knife away,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"I\'ll tell you everything you want to know.\"
======================================================================================================

\"I prefer to keep it just where it is,\" Captain Kidd said. \"Your reputation does precede you.\"
==================================================================================================

Captain Kidd did move the knife a minuscule distance from Emily Dickinson\'s throat.
====================================================================================

\"Spill,\" Captain Kidd said.
=============================

\"Things inside the Coalition are quite tense,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"The Pantherans keep having reasons to have a greater military presence and less autonomy by the races inside the Coalition. Their spy networks are so good it is difficult for any organized resistance to their activity to be effective. The Solar League has appealed to the Consortium for help. The planets on the Southern Frontier are not organized so they cannot be of much held. Mostly those planets are either agricultural or held by families like on Fair Haven. The Consortium can do a few things\--I\'m not at liberty to say anything about what they are doing and I don\'t know a lot anyway\--but this operation on Hypatia seemed worth pursuing. It might just give us a way to work around the Pantherans.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"How?\" I asked. \"This was hundreds of years ago. Tamara hasn\'t found anything to put human beings on this planet.\"
=======================================================================================================================

\"That she has old you about,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"Apparently, Cuthbert has found things and not told her. He\'s threatened their historian\--I don\'t know her name.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================

\"Juliet Maxwell,\" Josh said a bit too quickly.
================================================

\"Right, Juliet Maxwell,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"She gave him reports but she was not allowed to give them to Tamara. Cuthbert, in turn, was going to sell this information to Denise Kahlil.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And she was going to pay?\" The Czarina asked.
================================================

\"She was,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"But not for the Solar League Examiner. She is a go-between for another organization.\"
===========================================================================================================================

\"Do we know who?\" I asked.
============================

\"We think we do,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"We think she worked for the Pantherans as part of their information gathering network.\"
====================================================================================================================================

\"So she was a spy,\" The Czarina said.
=======================================

\"Bingo,\" Emily Dickinson said. \"I could not let her pass that information on. I needed to get to her before she notified the Pantherans that we knew she was working for them.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you just kill people,\" I said.
====================================

\"Emily Dickinson tried to shrug but the movement caused Captain Kidd to move the knife closer. \"It happens,\" he said. \"I don\'t think you understand\--\"
=============================================================================================================================================================

\"I understand that governments outside the Pharaoh Star System are acting inside the Pharaoh Star System,\" I said.
====================================================================================================================

\"Humanity needs to survive,\" Emily Dickinson said.
====================================================

\"I\'m surviving quite well,\" I said. \"I think we\'re done here, people.\"
============================================================================

\"And what about him?\" Captain Kidd asked.
===========================================

\"What about him?\" I asked. \"He got here on his own. He can leave on his own.\"
=================================================================================

\"I think you should all go and I\'ll take care of him,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I don\'t like other people messing around in my territory.\"
===========================================================================================================================================

That would be the voice of the League of Hypatian Pirates speaking.
===================================================================

I had a big decision to make. It would involve Emily Dickinson\'s life. If I walked out that door, Emily Dickinson would most likely die. Did I want that? No, of course not. But high stakes politics was not my forte and I did not like it playing out this way on Hypatia. Yes, we ran it like a frontier town and most anything went, but this did not feel right at all.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Let\'s take him with us,\" I said.
====================================

\"Let\'s,\" said The Czarina. \"I\'d like an exclusive interview. Billy, dear, can you arrange that.\"
======================================================================================================

\"Jolly well I can,\" Captain Kidd said happily. \"Let\'s go\>\"
================================================================

Captain Kidd, The Czarina and Emily Dickinson went outside to get in the flier. I let them go. I wanted to look at the bodies.
==============================================================================================================================

When I finished looking through their pockets, I had a tidy pile of items.
==========================================================================

\"Looks like information to be passed,\" Josh said.
===================================================

\"Yes, it does,\" I said. \"I\'m taking this with me.\"
=======================================================

\"Where do you think they parked?\" Josh asked.
===============================================

\"That\'s my next order of business,\" I said. \"Emily Dickinson got here. Each one of them got here. There must be fliers around somewhere.\"
==============================================================================================================================================

\"Would our flier know?\" Josh asked. \"Is it capable of such scanning?\"
=========================================================================

\"I\'ll ask,\" I said and brought up the flier\'s channel.
==========================================================

The flier matter-of-factly directed us to an underground parking area. It was a vast cavern, perhaps natural, under the villa.
==============================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. Josh and I Are in the Private Parking Area of the Villa**

It took us some time to walk there. The villa looked small on the outside but it was extremely extensive on the inside. The room we had first entered was a reception area. It could serve as a convenient living area. A kitchen was nearby. But when we went farther, we discovered this area was just to let people think it was a small villa. There were much more lavish areas underground\--rooms and rooms. I had been to Adam Worth\'s official residence. It was large, gaudy and filled with expensive furnishings and artwork. This villa seemed to be furnished with equally expensive items and a larger collection of artwork. I wondered if anyone else knew of it. It could fund Tamara\'s operation all by itself and it was here for the taking. There was no claim on this villa. I checked while I walked. There would be no harm in putting a claim in, I thought, so I did. I had the financial resources to even put a claim of formal ownership. As I reached the cavern where a number of fliers were parked, the registration office back in Ptolemy City accepted my claim and deducted the funds from my account.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"A smart move,\" Josh said. \"What about the bodies?\"
=======================================================

\"I\'m sure there is a way to deal with it,\" I said. \"You\'re going to check with the house AI.\"
===================================================================================================

Josh got busy as I went to the different fliers.
================================================

There were several fliers of different design that I thought could safely be classified as belonging to the villa. After these, there were three more. One was clearly marked as a rental. I went through it, found pieces of luggage that were definitely belonging to Denise Kahlil and removed them. I would check them out later. After checking the cargo hold, I instructed the flier\'s simple AI to fly back to its rental slot at the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. The rental agency would be glad to have it back. They would ask no questions. I went through Denise Kahlil\'s things.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

There was clothing and other personal items. I set them aside. There was her cred-pack. I put those in my bag. Among her identification information were tickets for a shuttle and passage back to the Solar League via Three Ravens. I could cash them in on Alexandria Space Station. They were not part of her personal profile but were stand-alone items which could not be traced to her. Perhaps the Solar League Examiner had paid for them. Perhaps the Pantherans had paid for them. In either case, they did not want any record of the transaction on file. As a result, I could cash them in and would. This job was turning out to be very different from what Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo had represented it to be. I would need to pay my people regardless of how things ended between Gyllian and me. These tickets would do just that.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I also went into the base flier. Like the base itself, this flier was very basic. That was good for my purposes. I went through all the information Josh and I discovered on the bodies of the two dead people. They were not encrypted which surprised me. Maybe that just meant one had unencrypted his or her files before handing it over to the other one who had not yet put his or her encryption on it. I could not be sure. It did make things easier for me.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Here was a list of all the finds. The people who lived in those tunnels were definitely human. There was a lot of information here. I copied all the files to my link, encrypted them and set them aside for future reading. I then started on Kahlil\'s files.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Yes, here was information about her contact. She was to pass it on to Cuthbert. That was why it was unencrypted. Further into the drive here were encrypted files. Josh I would have to look at these. There was her calendar. Ah, she had a meeting ith her contact after she left here. The meeting was at Three Ravens. Did the Pantherans stop at Three Ravens? Star had not indicated they did when we were there. Maybe non-military Pantherans were now frequenting Three Ravens. Something to check out for completeness. The other information looked to be work-related for the Solar League Examiner.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Josh came aboard the base flier.
================================

\"Everything is reset,\" Josh told me. \"Apparently, a lot of the security features were disabled prior to anyone coming here. I installed the same system here as at your villa. You should be able to come and go as you please now.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Good work.\" I said.
======================

Josh said, \"I\'ll send you the bill. Quick thinking to put in a claim.\"
=========================================================================

\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I need a way to pay you.\"
================================================

\"Should be possible now,\" Josh said. \"What have you found.\"
===============================================================

\"The info on the dig,\" I said, \"and contact info for Denise Kahlils handler. I think Cuthbert was supposed to meet this contact down the road. Denise Kahlil had a meeting set up for when she reached three Ravens.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But she won\'t make it,\" Josh said.
======================================

\"No, she won\'t,\" I said. \"I\'m going to cash in her ticket.\"
=================================================================

\"It was anonymous then?\" Josh asked.
======================================

\"It sure was,\" I said, \"as was her shuttle ticket and her flier rental. That reminds me, now that we\'re both inside, I should be sending that one on its way.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================

\"Captain Kidd left a while ago,\" Josh said. \"He said he would be in touch with us after he turned Emily Dickinson over to the League of Hypatian Pirates for questioning. The Czarina is happily asking him all sorts of questions. He\'s cooperating with her.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"There\'s no telling what the League will do,\" I said.
========================================================

\"You think it will go badly for him?\" Josh asked. He became quite pensive.
============================================================================

\"I think if he talks it will be fine,\" I said. \"He has an opportunity to bring the League up to speed. That could be mutually beneficial. It could even be the reason we were called in. We can also get this material,\" I tapped one of the drives, \"back to Tamara along with her flier.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And what are we going to do?\" Josh asked.
============================================

\"A lot of thinking when we get back,\" I said.
===============================================

\"I almost forgot,\" I added, \"I need to send the house bots to deal with the bodies.\"
========================================================================================

\"Already done,\" Josh said. \"There was a routine in the AI for that. They\'ll clean up everything, deal with the bodies and security systems have deleted all record of the encounter. I did save you a copy.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I don\'t particularly want to watch that,\" I said.
=====================================================

\"You might find the conversation interesting,\" Josh said, \"disturbing, but interesting.\"
============================================================================================

\"What did they say?\" I asked.
===============================

\"I didn\'t listen to it all,\" Josh said, \"but more was said than I think is on the drives you have.\"
========================================================================================================

\"Then when we get together with the others, we\'ll review it,\" I said.
========================================================================

\"Then are we ready to go to the base?\" Josh asked.
====================================================

\"We are,\" I said, and instructed the base flier accordingly.
==============================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Ten: Josh and I talk with Tamara***
        ----------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Scene 1. Josh and I Break the News of Cuthbert\'s Death to Tamara**

The flight through the ring of volcanoes was tense. The base flier strained to get through the pass. Thankfully, it had enough power to make it to the base. If it had not enough power, Josh and I would have been stranded and would have died. Neither of us had considered the possibilities. We needed to check on power and radio contact abilities. We were learning the hard way how to survive on this hostile planet of ours. We were creatures of the dome around Ptolemy City. Although I had been in space for a much longer time than Josh had, I had been in the care of an experienced star runner. I found spaceships confining and space travel filled with unrelenting boredom, but I did not experience the fear of not getting to our destination. Star\'s confidence and competence permeated Star\'s ship and I never doubted Star\'s ability to get us to where we were going safely. I now had an inkling of what that took and Star made it look easy.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara was, of course, surprised to see us, grateful that we had come to tell her what had transpired, angry with Cuthbert and distressed about Juliet. I handed her the drive. Tamara called Juliet into her office.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Cuthbert is dead!\" Juliet cried. \"How terrible. Someone just shot him?\"
============================================================================

\"He was selling us out to a Pantheran agent,\" Tamara said. \"I feel no remorse at all about him being killed. Now tell me why you didn\'t tell me what was happening?\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

\"I couldn\'t tell you,\" Juliet said, beginning to weep. \"Cuthbert threatened me. He said\-- he said\--\"
===========================================================================================================

We waited for her to get herself under control in order to tell us.
===================================================================

\"Cuthbert said you would suppress the information,\" Juliet finally said. \"He said you were going to hand it over to the Consortium and they would suppress the information, that they want to keep this whole operation a secret. He said by working with him, the information would be made public and everyone would learn about it. He said we could throw off the Pantheran yoke if we could keep the information from you and the Consortium. He said we could get funding ourselves for this research when our grant ran out and you would leave. I believed him. I still believe him.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara looked at me.
====================

\"From an initial read of files I picked up at the place where Cuthbert was killed,\" I said, \"it looks like Cuthbert\'s contact was working for the Pantherans. At this point, I think Cuthbert was selling this dig out to the Pantherans. You may be right\--Cuthbert did not know the reporter worked for the Pantherans.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"She\'s dead, too, isn\'t she?\" Juliet asked.
===============================================

\"She is,\" I said.
===================

\"So what is going to happen?\" Juliet asked.
=============================================

\"To begin with, you are going to show me what you found,\" Tamara said.
========================================================================

\"OK,\" Juliet said. \"I guess I\'ll have to do that now.\"
===========================================================

\"Yes, you will,\" Tamara said. \"You still work for me and you still have a contract with the University of the Gifted Mind. Let\'s go and see what you found.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. Juliet Shows Us the Missing Artifacts**

Again we all suited up and wended our way through many tunnels in the underground complex the archaeological workers had started to call The Big Dig. I lost track of the tunnel branches we took. I knew I was deep underground as we traveled down several ramps. F=At last, we entered a small room with several tables.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"This is what we have found so far,\" Juliet said, pointing to the several tables filled with small items. \"They all date from about seven hundred and fifty-three years ago. We haven\'t found any big things, no information cubes, no way to identify who these people were or where they came from. But we do know humans were here.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

She picked up an item. \"Here is a family portrait. The clothes do not tell us which planet these people were from. They are people clad in the right clothing for the period.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================

She picked up another item. \"This is a glove. As you can see, it would fit a human hand.\"
===========================================================================================

All the objects were like that. Just every day things that every day people would use. They fit the time frame. They told us nothing specific. People would use these items every day to maintain themselves. That was all.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Any clue about the room with the paintings?\" Tamara asked.
=============================================================

\"Nothing,\" Juliet said. Se seemed q;quite dispirited and not willing to engage Tamara in a conversation about the Big Dig.
============================================================================================================================

We all went back to Tamara\'s office.
=====================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 3. Back in Tamara\'s Office**

Tamara dismissed Juliet admonishing her to write up her reports and schedule sessions with the psychobot.
=========================================================================================================

\"I can\'t counsel her about the abuse she suffered under Cuthbert,\" Tamara said. \"I didn\'t like the way I saw him treating her, but it looked more personal than professional. Goes to show what I know.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara looked so tired and even more dispirited than Juliet.
============================================================

\"You think you know people,\" Tamara said. \"Cuthbert could be rude, crude and lude, but he was always an excellent person to have in charge of the actual dig. Now I come to find he was working behind my back and abusing one of my staff. I wonder if I should get into a different business.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It\'s not your fault,\' I said, knowing that in a way it was her fault. Tamara knew it. Tamara knew I knew it but she kept silent while I spoke. \"The question for me is this: What are you going to do with the Consortium of Planets?\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I was born on Earth,\" Tamara said, \"but my parents left there for the Northern Frontier when I was a little girl. We went to the Long John Silver System. It\'s a long way out from the core planets of the Consortium. My parents died there. I became a ward of the space station manager, a woman by the name of Prudence Wu. One day a star runner docked at our station and ate at the diner where I worked. We talked. Star was so naive about everything human. It was like educating a little kid but Star was all grown up. I found I could pour out my troubles to Star and Star would listen. Star never forgot, never did not listen. My dream was to go to University. There was money to send me but no way to get me there. Star took me. Prudence Wu made Star my legal guardian which was weird, but Star made all the necessary arrangements for me to enroll at the University of the Gifted Mind and stay there. I don\'t know how much Star paid the University. My financial aid was never enough.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I wondered where Tamara was going with this. I could tell Josh was wondering, too.
==================================================================================

\"I know the Pantherans treated Star very badly,\" Tamara went on. \"I know Star would be dead if Gyllie had not helped Star and intervened on Star\'s behalf with the Pantherans. I know the Intelligence Branch of the Pantherans went after you on the Featherote planet and kicked us out of the Prince Hat System. But I just can\'t imagine the Pantherans are out to annihilate us. It seems to me they might want to re-establish their empire, but they need people like us to lord it over. I like living on the Northern Frontier and I like being free of all their restrictions. But what I learn from archeology is that there are always forces stronger than you out there in the universe, in the western spiral arm if you want to make it specific to our situation. That makes me think we may need the Pantherans to defend us. They have been the ones with military capabilities in this part of the galaxy for thousands of years. That could prove to be important.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara went silent.
===================

\"Archeology should be simple,\" Tamara said. \"But it can be so political. We found that out at Prince Hat. We\'re finding it out here.\"
==========================================================================================================================================

\"What will you do?\" I asked.
==============================

\"Ask Gyllie some hard questions,\" Tamara said. \"I\'ve always known she worked for the Ministry of Defense. I\'ve never really known what she does. But this seems out of character for her to me. I need some answers. I need to think.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We\'ll need to take the flier,\" I said. \"I can send it back to you when it powers up after going through the ring of volcanoes. I did think I needed to get here as soon as possible.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I appreciate that,\" Tamara said. \"Please don\'t leave us stranded here.\"
=============================================================================

\"I won\'t,\" I promised.
=========================

Josh and I returned to the villa beyond the ring of volcanoes. The base flier charged up quickly and we sent it on its way. We looked at the other fliers parked there. One looked quite sporty and we really wanted to take it, but instead we chose a modest flier, radioed Faros Lighthouse Spaceport and found a spot near my flier to park it.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Now we had to sit down with our other team members, share notes and make a plan.Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo had a lot of explaining to do.
===========================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Chapter Eleven What Is Going On?**

        -   ### **Scene 1. We Try to Figure Out What is Going On**

We gathered at 17 Dollar Bay Drive in the beautiful house by Torch Lake. Josh was there,The Czarina and Captain Kidd.
=====================================================================================================================

\"What happened to Emily Dickinson,\" I asked when we were gathered in the spacious room overlooking the lake. Today several powered sailboats were traveling up and down the narrow lake. The sails were for show. Although air circulates throughout Ptolemy City, there is no wind to speak of. The sails are braced so that they appear to be full and functional. One of the house bots served drinks and there were what Mrs. Parge calls nibbles set out on a low table.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Wat did you do with Emily Dickinson?\" I asked.
=================================================

\"We turned him over to the League of Hypatian Pirates,\" The Czarina said. \"That is what you said to do.\"
============================================================================================================

\"And,\" I said. Surely there was more.
=======================================

\"They will interrogate him,\" The Czarina said.
================================================

\"I think I need more specificity,\" I said and turned to Captain Kidd.
=======================================================================

He nibbled a chip before speaking.
==================================

\"Emily Dickinson is willing to talk,\" Captain Kidd said. \"The thing is, he is too willing to talk. That makes a pirate like me very suspicious.\"
====================================================================================================================================================

\"You had a knife to his throat,\" Josh said. \"What else would he do?\"\"
==========================================================================

\"Emily Dickinson is an intelligence officer,\" Captain Kidd said, reaching for a Lacey cookie. \"He\'s former Solar League military. I think his conditioning would still be in play.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Conditioning?\" Josh asked. \"What do you mean?\"
===================================================

\"People in his line of work are psychologically conditioned,\" Captain Kidd said between bytes. \"My holding a knife to his throat should not have concerned him. It did.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s just sensible,\" Josh said. \"I\'d tell you anything you wanted to know if you held a knife to my throat.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"Good to know,\" Captain Kidd said, wiping his mouth with a cloth napkin daintily.
===================================================================================

\"I thought that was the point of holding the knife,\" Josh said. He was sitting on the edge of his chair. He was obviously anxious and becoming strident in his tone.
======================================================================================================================================================================

\"I think we\'re playing a deeper game here,\" Captain Kidd said. \"Emily Dickinson was talkative on our flight back. No intelligence officer would do that.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================

\"And what do you think about that?\" I asked. I was quickly losing control of this meeting and feeling way out of my depth to boot.
====================================================================================================================================

\"I think the Consortium of Planets has an end game we don\'t understand,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I have no idea what it is except that it involves the big cats. I think Emily Dickinson will only tell us what he or his handlers want us to know. I don\'t think he\'ll give up any more.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So how can we figure out what is going on?\" I asked. \"Detective methods don\'t seem to apply here.\"
========================================================================================================

We sat is silence for a while, munching and sipping. The house bots refreshed our drinks and brought out more snacks.
=====================================================================================================================

\"I\'ve been racking my brain to recall any hints about new trouble with the Pantherans,\" The Czarina said. \"There seems to be an up tick in their propaganda streams. I don\'t particularly pay attention to them, but the number of items has seemed to increased. I sample them from time to time. The gist of them seems to be that the Pantheran presence makes the other races safer.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"If that\'s true\--I don\'t mean that their presence makes us safer,\" I said, \"what are they protecting us against?\"
========================================================================================================================

\"That\'s the thing,\" The Czarina said, \"the explanations are vague. There is an implied threat\-\--forces against our way of life\--that sort of thing. There are always pictures of happy people doing happy things.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"A carefree life, a pleasant life, a happy life,\" I said.
===========================================================

\"Exactly,\" The Czarina replied. \"There are no pictures of work: factories, fields, people in labs or anything like that.\"
=============================================================================================================================

\"So if we don\'t support the Pantherans, we will lose the good life,\" Josh said.
==================================================================================

\"That\'s what I think the message is,\" The czarina said.
==========================================================

\"Same old, same old stuff,\" Captain Kidd pronounced.
======================================================

\"Not exactly,\" The Czarina said. \"Their presence doesn\'t make our lives better. Their presence doesn\'t make our lives more productive. Their presence makes our lives more carefree. We can enjoy our pleasures because their presence makes us safe.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Bread and circuses,\" Captain Kidd said.
==========================================

\"What?\" Josh asked.
=====================

\"On ancient Earth the Romans, the powerful people of the day, gave their subjects food and entertainment in return for their support.\"
========================================================================================================================================

Josh frowned. I considered.
===========================

\"So they want to divert our attention from something,\" I said.
================================================================

\"Agreed,\" The Czarina said.
=============================

\"But what?\" Josh asked.
=========================

\"From taking charge of our own lives,\" Captain Kidd said. He stretched. \"You kids grew up with all the legends of the Hypatian pirates, with stories of treasure and pirates roaming space, praying on the weak and the defenseless. Pirates have treasure and they do pray on the weak and the defenseless. But pirates are more than common criminals\--at least some of us are. There are thugs, of course.\" Captain Kidd glanced in The Czarina\'s direction. Her former husband, Deadly Dudley, was one of those thugs. \"Posthumous Patty Parine and Dagger Dan Duncan illustrate the worst of the pirate fraternity. Pirates\--the real pirates\--are folks who like their freedom and like operating with few restrictions. Your Captain Star Runner is a natural pirate, Ronnie. I always supported that cat\'s inclusion in the League.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Star is not mine,\" I said and felt an unexpected pang.
=========================================================

\"My error,\" Captain Kidd said. \"My point is, being a pirate is a frame of mind. It\'s why we came to the Pharaoh Star System in the first place. It\'s why we let the independent business people come here and develop Ptolemy City and let the medical people set up Aesculapius. We want to encourage independent thinkers and people who want to get away from the herd mentality.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"If I accept that premise,\" I said, \"the pirates would have common cause then with the Consortium of Planets which operates on the frontier, outside of direct Pantheran control.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Bingo,\" Captain Kidd said. \"An agent of the Consortium now has direct access to the top people of the League of Hypatian Pirates.\"
=======================================================================================================================================

\"So you think we were set up to make that connection,\" I said. \"How do Cuthbert and Denise Kahlil fit into the picture.\"
============================================================================================================================

\"If they are agents of the Pantherans,\" The Czarina said, \"they would have to be eliminated. Colonel Romeres Lujo brings us in and we make the transfer of Emily Dickinson to the League officials. We do it quietly and no one is the wiser. It looks like League justice and everyone goes on their way. If anyone heard or saw anything, they\'ll forget about it.\" And turning to me, \"Nice move claiming that villa. I\'m sure Josh has it locked down for you.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Buttoned up tight,\" Josh said. \"Looked like a professional neutralized the AI.\"
====================================================================================

\"That would be Consortium expertise at your service,\" Captain Kidd said.
==========================================================================

\"I hope I can reconstruct what they did,\" Josh said.
======================================================

\"Good luck with that,\" Captain Kidd said. \"You won\'t find anything to hang on to.\"
=======================================================================================

\"As interesting as all this is,\" I said, \"I\'m trying to figure out where we fit and if we still have work to do.\" My head was aching. Conspiracies have never interested me and this seemed like conspiracies within conspiracies.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd shook his head. \"The question is,\" he said, \"should we continue to be involved. We\'re pawns in a bigger game the way things stand at the moment. The Consortium may not have our best interests at heart.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you\'re saying,\" I said, \"we need to find out the bigger picture before we do anything else.\"
=====================================================================================================

\"I\'d say so,\" The Czarina said. \"Ronnie, darling, I have to be very careful about my reputation. I can\'t work if people think I\'m just a shill for the Consortium.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================

I rubbed my temples. \"Czarina, I would do nothing to hurt your reputation,\" I said. \"I had no idea this job was so complex. I just thought we were going to listen and I help out Tamara here I could.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It\'s not your fault, darling,\" The Czarina said. \"I just wanted you to understand my concern.\"
====================================================================================================

I turned to Josh. \"I\'ve heard Captain Kidd\'s and The Czarina\'s concerns. What about you?\"
==============================================================================================

Josh shifted uneasily in his chair. He did not look at me. These were clear signs he was trying to avoid my question.
=====================================================================================================================

\"Spill,\" I said.
==================

\"I don\'t like the violence,\" Josh said. \"I can\'t see how staying in this one makes any sense. Can you break the contract?\"
================================================================================================================================

I was about to say I would have the legal service I used review the contact when a priority message came over my link. It was text this time.I read it out to the group:
========================================================================================================================================================================

We need to talk face to face. I\'ll be on Alexandria Space Station this evening. Text when you arrive.
======================================================================================================

\"It\'s from Gyllian,\" I said.
===============================

\"Or not,\" Captain Kidd said.
==============================

\"I\'ll check it out,\" Josh said, bringing a screen into view with a hand gesture. \"The voice message checked out.\"
======================================================================================================================

\"I was wondering about that,\" Captain Kidd said.
==================================================

\"It\'s genuine,\" Josh said.
=============================

\"I\'ll go with you,\" Captain Kidd said. \"Someone needs your back.\"
======================================================================

\"Billy, do you think that is wise?\" The Czarina asked.
========================================================

\"I can\'t let our Ronnie go up there alone,\" Captain Kidd said. \"It would be like sending a lamb into the wolf pack. I can\'t do that. I\'ve known this chica since she was knee high to nothing.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

It was true. I never thought of Captain Kidd and I being close, but we had known each other for most of my life. He was always fond of me. Now he was going to accompany me to the Alexandria Space Station as my body guard. Well, I certainly would not argue with having him along. All this high stakes maneuvering was beyond my level of competency to navigate well.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Scene 2. We Come Face to Face with Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo At Last
=======================================================================

I booked Captain Kidd and myself on the early evening shuttle from Faros Lighthouse Spaceport to the Alexandria Space Station. There was no need to incur the expense of using our own flier. It meant we would not have our own transportation available to leave the space station but Captain Kidd assured me that off we needed to make a fast getaway he could arrange something.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We might end up at Over the Moon,\" he told me, \"but if you want to get away from someone that would be a handy place to go.\"
=================================================================================================================================

I shivered. The last time I was at Over the Moon, the pirate spaceport, I had almost died.
==========================================================================================

Captain Kidd patted my shoulder.
================================

\"You\'ll be safe with me, Ronnie,\" he said. \"Don\'t worry.\"
===============================================================

I started to worry big time then. If Captain Kidd thought we needed an exit strategy hat included Over the Moon, I wondered what I had gotten us into. I never thought of Gyllian as devious. I knew she had manipulated Star in the past for her own ends, but Star had not understood human ways of doing things at the time. Star did not hold a grudge about it. I wondered if that was a stance I should adopt or if I should demand explanations. I did not think Gyllian could manipulate Captain Kidd. I hated to admit it. I think of myself as having a lot of street smarts, but clearly I was not handling this situation well.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I\'m here.
==========

I sent the message from the departure area.
===========================================

I see you. Who are you with?
============================

Captain Kidd\--one of my team.
==============================

Then I added:
=============

He goes where I go.
===================

Very well. Meet me in the coffee shop.
======================================

The texts were rapid fire. I did not see Gyllian but that meant nothing. She might have had high powered lenses turned on the the arrival area.
===============================================================================================================================================

We walked briskly to the coffee shop. I did not expect to be shot. Captain Kidd looked around carefully. Later he would tell me he was more concerned about kidnapping than shooting. I was glad I did not know that at the time.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The coffee shop was busy. Arrivals and departures prompted people to get something to eat or drink or just sit and work their link in a comfortable chair.
==========================================================================================================================================================

I looked around. I saw a woman sitting by herself. I walked over. It did not look like Gyllian but there was no one else.
=========================================================================================================================

\"May we sit here?\" I asked.
=============================

The woman nodded. Captain Kidd and I ordered. The woman looked us over. She continued to say nothing. I felt very uncomfortable and resisted the urge to chatter. If I finished my tea and Gyllian did not arrive, I would catch the next shuttle back to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport and break the contract.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian walked into the coffee shop and made her way in a round about manner to our table. The silent woman got up and left. Gyllian ordered coffee.
====================================================================================================================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Eleven What Is Going ON? Continued***
        ------------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Scene 2 Continued. We Come Face to Face with Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo**

\"What is going on, Gyllian,\" I asked. I wanted answers and I wanted them now.
===============================================================================

\"Hello, Ronnie,\" Gyllian said easily. \"Who is your companion?\"
==================================================================

I wanted to snap: You know perfectly well who Captain Kidd is. I\'m sure you\'re following us, listening into us. You know every thought we have and every move we make. I restrained myself. Maybe civility would get me further than rudeness.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"This is one of the members of my team. He is Captain William Kidd.\" And turn to Captain Kidd I said, \"This is Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.\"
=================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd inclined his head. \"I know who she is,\" he said to me.
=====================================================================

\"Captain Kidd,\" Gyllian said with all assuredness. \"I\'m pleased to make your acquaintance.\"
================================================================================================

\"I doubt it,\" Captain Kidd said. He sounded like he was grinding the words out.
=================================================================================

\"Tell me how Emily Dickinson is,\" Gyllian continued, not responding to Captain Kidd\'s comments. \"You took him to the League of Hypatian Pirates, correct?\"
===============================================================================================================================================================

\"We did,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I presume that is what you wanted\--a cover story to have him talk with the League. We have him in protective custody as I am sure you also wanted.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian was going to say something smart, but then she changed her mind. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"That is both helpful and perceptive on your part.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================

\"You need to bring us into the picture,\" I said. \"My team is uncertain if they want to continue with the contract. We need a reason to stay the course.\"
============================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian frowned. This was not playacting. It had never occurred to her that my team might bail on her. Well, what did she expect? Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo was used to commanding. It was \"Yes, Ma\'am\" and \"No, Ma\'am\" but there was never \"I\'m out of here. See you around.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd and I waited. Come to think of it, there is a lot of waiting in my line of work.
=============================================================================================

\"You deserve an explanation,\" Gyllian finally said.
=====================================================

I knew Captain Kidd and I both knew a full explanation would not be forthcoming. Part of an explanation might be shared with us.
================================================================================================================================

\"There is trouble in the Coalition,\" Gyllian said, lowering her voice.
========================================================================

\"You\'ll have to speak up,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I\'m an old man and even with the advances of medical science and technology, I can\'t hear you. Spring for the muffler and speak up.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian frowned. I showed her the icon on the menu.
===================================================

\"The voice dampening field around the table is called a muffler,\" I said. \"I\'m told they are effective except for the most sophisticated technology. This is the Pharaoh Star System. Much business is conducted in this coffee shop. Everyone wants their conversations confidential. You pay for the field and they are.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian tapped the icon. We could hear the whisper of the field solidifying around us. The icon went from red to yellow to green.
=================================================================================================================================

\"OK,\" Captain Kidd said. \"What did you say?\"
================================================

\"There is trouble in the Coalition,\" Gyllian said.
====================================================

\"Nothing new there,\" Captain Kidd observed. His manner was impatient. My sense was that he wanted to make Gyllian uncomfortable and to push her into saying something she would rather hold back from us. The dynamic between them was interesting. Gyllian had put on a professional, no nonsense face. Captain Kidd was a hard-edge pirate. This was who they both were but I knew a different side to each of them.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Quite true,\" Gyllian finally said. \"There has always been friction between us and the Pantherans. As Ronnie and I know from personal experience, the ungendered Pantherans believe they are superior to all the other races. The only ones which are superior to them are the gendered Pantherans. I suspect this is drilled into the ungendered Pantherans throughout their upbringing and education. I almost think it is engineered into their DNA. Why else would they willingly show up to termination centers?\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian looked at me. \"I know Captain Star Runner did not do that, but he is a bit of an exception there. Nevertheless, even Captain Star Runner believes he is superior to us. He calls us friends and takes us seriously, even depends on our expertise, but in general Star Runner thinks he is superior.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That one is a mighty clever pirate,\" Captain Kidd allowed.
=============================================================

\"And uses his superior neural capability and ability to blaze his own trail through hyperspace at increased speeds to his advantage,\" Gyllian agreed.
=======================================================================================================================================================

\"We have an expression about people who have their noses in the air because they believe themselves better than everyone else. For Pantherans, it\'s their tails which are in the air proclaiming their superiority.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian paused to take a swig of her drink.
===========================================

\"This has been the case since we encountered Pantherans. And for the most part, we encounter ungendered Pantherans. They protect the gendered ones at all cost and keep them hidden from sight.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Why?\" I asked. I always wondered why this was.
=================================================

\"I think it is because there aren\'t too many of them,\" Gyllian said. \"I also think it is to make them mysterious and wonderful to the ungendered population.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

\"So what\'s changed?\" Captain Kidd asked a bit impatiently.
=============================================================

\"I need to remind myself that you are from the Pharaoh Star System. People from the Solar League come here all the time to conduct their business and relax. What do you call them?\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The Rich and Famous,\" I said.
================================

\"Right. The Rich and Famous. People who are either rich or famous or both are very focused on themselves. They are typically not concerned for the common people. They may set up foundations and support good works, but they don\'t usually get down and dirty. They come here and do their business and go home to their fortunes and their comfortable life styles. They are basically innocuous as far as the Pantherans are concerned. So long as they stay that way, the Pantherans have no problem letting them through the border to come here and letting them return.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The Pantherans watch. They know who leaves and who comes back. They make sure only the people who won\'t make waves politically or militarily or even socially do not come here. They are watchful for revolutionaries and terrorists.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd grunted. So What?
==============================

I had never thought of who came here to the Pharaoh Star System. Things were the way they were. I never questioned who came and who might be turned away.
=========================================================================================================================================================

\"They let the antonium and other precious metals in. They let supplies out, though they inspect them carefully,\" Gyllian continued. \"They let the sick out, too. They think our medical facilities and concern for those in need is peculiar, but they leave us alone in our, according to them, misguided approach to society.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But,\" I said, sensing Captain Kidd\'s restlessness and anting Gyllian to get to the point.
=============================================================================================

Gyllian ignored me.
===================

\"The ungendered like the status quo. They know what they are supposed to do and they do it very well. They resist change. The only way to have change is to educate the ungendered Pantherans differently and to terminate the older ones. That\'s wasteful of resource. It costs a lot to raise and train an ungendered Pantheran. You need a certain number of years to pay that off.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian turned to me. \"I know this personally,\" she said. \"I needed to come up with the money to pay off Star\'s debts. He has paid me back but it was dicey finding the money.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================

I had not known this. Apparently, there were a lot of things I did not know. This adventure was not written down as far as I knew. Sometimes Star referred to a difficult time obliquely, but I did not know the details.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"If a major decision comes down from the top, it is very costly,\" Gyllian explained. \"But we have noticed a change. Older Pantherans are not being declared surplus and terminated en mass, but there have been increases in the numbers of military Pantherans. They are more aggressive. They are assigned to border control. They are quicker to fire weapons and getting past customs and processing in and out of the Coalition is becoming more difficult. Have you noticed any decrease in the flow of people out here?\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Not yet,\" Captain Kidd said.
===============================

\"You might,\" Gyllian said. \"We are noticing it on both the Northern and Southern Frontiers.\"
================================================================================================

Gyllian took another swig of her drink. I wondered what it was, something cold. Did it have alcohol in it? Alcohol was served everywhere on Alexandria Space Station. Many people needed alcohol or drugs or both to have enough courage to step aboard a shuttle craft or a passenger liner for even a short trip. Their first experience into space could land them here and sooner or later they would have to leave. Alexandria Space Station did not have a lot of permanent residents.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I thought of Tara Lee. She was among the small population that called this station home. I wondered if I would see her on this visit. I wondered if I wanted to.
================================================================================================================================================================

\"We also know they have requested more military craft from the Featherote Charm,\" Gyllian went on. \"This suggests a military build up of some sort. As we have no intelligence on an external threat, we suspect a change in the Pantheran attitude.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"A change?\" Captain Kidd asked. \"A military change?\"
========================================================

\"Yes,\" Gyllian said. \"We think, and this is highly speculative, that there are forces within the Pantheran gendered population to be more imperial.\"
========================================================================================================================================================

\"To bring back the Pantheran Empire,\" I said. I might just as well put that out.
==================================================================================

Gyllian stared at me.
=====================

\"What do you know about the Pantheran Empire?\" she asked.
===========================================================

\"It\'s a phrase I\'ve heard Star use from time to time,\" I said. Was I betraying a confidence? Was I helping humanity? I was not sure and it made me very anxious. I want always to do the right thing.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian nodded, more to herself than me. \"Star fancies himself a student of history,\" she said. \"His view is very simplistic and very much colored by a very biased education. Nevertheless, that is generally correct. We believe there is a faction that wants to do away with the Coalition and re-establish the Empire.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"All very interesting speculation,\" Captain Kidd said, heaving a very dramatic sigh which I suspected was more theatrical than real. \"But what does that ave to do with an archaeological dig and us?\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian finished her drink and ordered another. I was certain now hat she was drinking alcohol and her drinks were doubles.
===========================================================================================================================

\"I have told you what we have observed,\" Gyllian said. \"I think this means there will be a push to re-establish the Pantheran Empire and dispense with the autonomy that the other races within the Coalition have. This is a minority viewpoint. Generally the Solar League and the Consortium of Planets believe there is some sort of external threat and we are well-served by this increase in a Pantheran military presence. They believe being concerned about this build up and voicing it is antithetical to good relations with the Pantherans and will jeopardize human protection when and if this external threat appears.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What was she saying? I had an idea but I could not parse it well. Captain Kidd was much better at this.
=======================================================================================================

\"But there is no threat,\" Captain Kidd said. \"No one in the League of Hypatian Pirates has any knowledge of a threat. We know about the Azulees. They are not a threat and won\'t be for a thousand years or more.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian blinked. She had knot known knowledge of the Azulees was that well-known. They were an amphibious race wig a vision of galactic domination but were in no way able to confront the Pantherans. If the League of Hypatian Pirates knew about the Azulees, perhaps the Pantherans did as well.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"The Fungusian Network believes the Pantherans will some day fall,\" Gyllian said. \"But it won\'t be to the Azulees. I don\'t know why they haven\'t crushed them yet, but they will.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And they are waiting because?\" Captain Kidd asked.
=====================================================

\"They\'re focused on the Coalition,\" Gyllian said. \"In my opinion, they are obsessed with restoring their empire and eliminating the Coalition. They just don\'t want to fight a war to do it. That would be very expensive. I think they have realized how soft their gendered class is and it will take time to cull that portion of the population and make themselves more able to restore imperial rule. I don\'t know the inner workings of that part of Pantheran society, but it is complicated in the same way the ungendered population is complicated. They have many designs and much to balance.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And where do we come in?\" Captain Kidd asked, losing interest in the mechanizations of Pantheran society and Coalition politics.
===================================================================================================================================

Gyllian took another gulp of her drink.
=======================================

\"I\'ve been removed from my position,\" she said. \"I\'ve been stripped of my rank. I\'ve been put on permanent leave.\"
=========================================================================================================================

I was shocked. Gyllian was always a rising star in the Consortium. How could they have kicked her out? What had she done?
=========================================================================================================================

Captain Kidd was the first to speak. \"Now that\'s a damn shame,\" he said. \"You\'re a smart one. They don\'t like all this talk of worrying about the cats and them lording it over us?\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"No, they don\'t,\" Gyllian said. \"They think my opinions will cause trouble and they don\'t want any trouble. They want to negotiate and make things better, get the border patrol to back down.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Ain\'t gonna happen if they programmed those cats to be nasty,\" Captain Kidd said.
=====================================================================================

I knew the ungendered were not programmed. Star would call it designed. What might be happening is that their AIs were more aggressive and always presented the more aggressive course of action. That was where programming came into play.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It is the AIs, isn\'t it?\" I asked Gyllian.
==============================================

\"Yes, I think so,\" she said, drinking her drink again. Her hands were shaking.
================================================================================

\"You must be devastated,\" I said, realizing I had not responded to her announcement.
======================================================================================

\"Yes, but also angry and determined to do something about it,\" Gyllian said. \"This is a suicidal policy.\"
=============================================================================================================

\"And where does the dig come in?\" I asked.
============================================

\"Tamara\'s last report,\" Gyllian said, \"the one she sent when she discovered the artifacts that were being held back\--she says there are indications this was some sort of experimental colony. As there are no records of this, I\'m wondering what the experiment was.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It must have failed,\" Captain Kidd said. \"There are no survivors.\"
=======================================================================

\"We don\'t know that,\" Gyllian said. \"They left the tunnels and covered up any word about themselves. Where did they go? Who did they become? I think they found a way to fight the Pantherans or at least escape from them. I want to know more about that. The Second Space Expansion was a bloody time. How did they get out here and how did they survive? If we could know that, there may be a way to resist the Pantherans when they come for us.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This was, of course, crazy talk. Like all conspiracies, it made a sort of sense, but I cold not see how an old colony on Hypatia would have any meaning for the future of humankind. Captain Kidd thought the same.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You might as well shut that place down,\" he said. \"You won\'t find anything important there.\"
==================================================================================================

But Captain Kidd was wrong about that.
======================================

-   -   ***Author\'s Note***
        --------------------

It looks like I have some time line issues. In \#Sanctuary\*, my 2010 Nanowrimo novel for Captain Star Runner, Star returns to the western spiral arm four years after breaking up with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Star finds Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo involved with Lester, a Professor at the University of the Gifted Mind. Emily Dickinson has gone to the Southern Frontier and has not been heard of since. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo encourages Star to contact Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Star does. Ronnie invites Star to come to the Pharaoh Star System. Star reunites with Ronnie at the Intergalactic Diner. Meanwhile, there are ongoing insurrections within the Coalition and Star does not think the Pantherans will use excessive force because they do not want to show their hand and their much superior military force.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This is a different time line than I am working on here. Only a year and some months have passed. The Pantherans seem to be ready to show excessive force, their shock and awe campaign. Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo is concerned that any revolutionary or terrorist act will bring the Pantherans down on the other races. For the arc I have in mind, Star needs to come back sooner and to Ronnie in a different state.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Some of this can be corrected by just moving this episode forward in time for Ronnie and the others. Additional Ronnie episodes could be written for the interim. All very confusing. However, these novellas are not set in stone and the inconsistencies can be left alone for now. It looks like I really have to start putting these stories in order and filling in the missing pieces. Lots of work for non-nanowrimo time. loll.

    -   ***Scene 1. We Are Still Talking with Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo in the Coffee Shop***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"What happens next,\" I asked. I wondered what the state of our contract was and what moral responsibilities I had here. Did I owe Gyllian Romeres Lujo anything? She was Captain Star Runner\'s friend and erstwhile lover. Star might feel the need to be loyal to her in good times and in bad times, but I did not think I needed to be loyal at all. Four years ago (A time line correction placed here.) I had spent some time with her on one of Captain Star Runner\'s adventures, but that was all. I knew her. That was all.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'d like you to keep working, listening,\" Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. \"I can pay you for a while longer. I keep thinking there\'s a link here and we need to know what it is.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Do you have any supporters on the Northern Frontier or in the Solar League?\" Captain Kidd asked.
===================================================================================================

Gosh, he was good. He had seemed a bungling old guy to me when I was growing up. The more I worked with Captain Kidd the more I respected his knowledge, expertise and just plain savvy. Maybe that bungling old pirate was an act. There was certainly a perceptive mind underneath all hat acting.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"There are a few with a similar perspective,\" Gyllian said. She pronounced her words very carefully. The liquor was taking hold.
==================================================================================================================================

I decided we should end this interview. Some say people speak the truth when they are drunk. Some say they let down their guard and the real personality shows through. I suspect an alternative personality shows through and people say things which could be outrageous because their judgment is impaired.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Are you staying on the station?\" I asked.
============================================

\"I\'ll be going down to check on Tamara,\" Gyllian said. \"Maybe I\'ll see you there.\"
========================================================================================

\"Perhaps,\" I agreed.
======================

I stood up. Captain Kidd followed my example.
=============================================

\"It was good to see you again,\" I said. I did not extend my hand. \"Keep me posted.\"
=======================================================================================

\"I will,\" Gyllian said. Now she was starting to slur her words.
=================================================================

-   -   ***Scene 2. On Alexandria Space Station***
        ------------------------------------------

We left Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo at the coffee shop with a fresh drink. We did not know who the woman was who sat at our table. Perhaps she was paid to sit there. There were lots of people around the station who would work for fifteen minutes holding a table. We did not ask Gyllian what she intended to do after she visited Tamara and the Big Dig. I wondered how everyone would be paid if this business dragged on. I had no idea how I would extricate myself from this business and still learn what its final outcome was.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What do you think?\" I asked Captain Kidd when we were outside the coffee shop. He made a slashing motion across his throat. Cut off talking. He led me toward one of the many nooks on the space station where private conversations could be held. He reached into a pocket and took out a privacy device. Like the one in the coffee shop, no one would be able to listen in on our conversation.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You should carry one of these,\" Captain Kidd admonished me. \"As a private investigator, I would have thought you would have used one of these lots of times.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

\"I have always used them in places like the coffee shop,\" I said. \"I\'ve never been in this situation before.\"
==================================================================================================================

\"Well now you are,\" Captain Kidd said, \"and you are fortunate I came prepared.\"
===================================================================================

\"I am,\" I agreed. Flattering Captain Kidd was always a wise move.
===================================================================

\"I\'ve been hearing rumors,\" Captain Kidd said. \"Don\'t believe everything I said back there. Skepticism is a good way to get a partisan talking. They\'ll try to convince you of their position. You have to listen to a lot of nonsense, but sometimes you learn some things by their interminable chattering and digressions.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And what have you learned?\" I asked.
=======================================

\"I did not learn much,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I had my suspicions confirmed.\"
===============================================================================

\"Suspicions?\" I asked.
========================

\"That the Solar League are fools,\" Captain Kidd sneered. \"They think kowtowing to the big cats will protect them.\"
======================================================================================================================

\"How can they stand up to the Pantherans?\" I asked. \"The Pantherans can close the jump gates like they did during the Second Space Expansion.\"
==================================================================================================================================================

\"They could make alliances outside the Coalition,\" Captain Kidd said. \"The League of Hypatian Pirates has contacts outside the Coalition. They could talk directly to the Fungusian Network. Josh has been doing that for years. I figure the Featherote Charm is pretty sick of being pushed around by the big cats. The birds produce the spaceships and the mushrooms put in their brains. It seems to be those two could hold the big cats in check.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I did not argue with Captain Kidd. I suspected the balance of power between these three races was very old and they would be less than eager to align themselves with human interests. But I listened to Captain Kidd.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"All that aside,\" he said, \"I figure things are not as desperate for Colonel Romeres Lujo as she would lead us to believe.
=============================================================================================================================

\"Her drinking seems to be very straight forward,\" I said. \"I have never seen her like that.\"
================================================================================================

\"And how well do you know her?\" Captain Kidd asked.
=====================================================

\"Not very,\" I admitted.
=========================

\"She could have a drinking problem and that\'s why they let her go. She could be acting and letting you think she was distressed about losing her job. It could all be a ruse to manipulate us. She could be out but out officially and letting the Ministry of Defense have plausible deniability if anything goes wrong. There are lots of reasons why what she told us is not all the truth or a slant on the truth.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But you think the gist of what she said is true,\" I asked, \"that the Pantherans want to exercise more direct control over the other races.\"
================================================================================================================================================

\"That I think is spot on,\" Captain Kidd said. \"I\'ve been hearing rumors to that effect and I didn\'t know how to confirm them. I\'m willing to bet it\'s true.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================

\"And do you think the Pharaoh Star System will be impacted?\" I asked.
=======================================================================

\"If that Tamara keeps poking around in that big dig of hers,\" Captain Kidd said, \"I think it is certain. I don\'t know what\'s down there, but I think she better close it up immediately. I don\'t think there is anything there to find, but I think the big cats won\'t take a chance. They could easily bomb it. It\'s a quick extraction into the Pharaoh Star System, drop a bomb and quick insert back into the Silence. It wouldn\'t have to be nuclear. It would shake a few things. Some volcano\'s could go crazy. Maybe a few earthquakes, but the Big Dig is far away from Ptolemy City. We might not even feel anything.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And what would happen next?\" I asked.
========================================

Captain Kidd shrugged. \"Everyone would be upset. They\'d want to go after them, of course, insist on our independence, etc., but nothing would happen. There is no ship in the League of Hypatian Pirates that could go up against one of their military vessels. We\'d be out gunned and outmaneuvered. I\'ve never sailed with Captain Star Runner, but I\'ve watched him run his ship from afar. He can run faster and slide in and out of the Silence more smoothly than any captain I\'ve ever met. And that\'s in a courier ship with little cargo space. The military vessels are so much bigger.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Star was trained to run those big military ships,\" I said. \"I\'ve heard Star was excellent at it.\"
=======================================================================================================

\"But as independent as a pig on ice,\" Captain Kidd said and smiled. \"That is one tough cat. Too bad he isn\'t here. He could give those big cats run for their money.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================

I was not sure it would be good if Star were here or if Star could or would give the Pantheran military a run for their money.
==============================================================================================================================

I was thinking about Star when Tara Lee walked by.
==================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. Walking with Tara Lee**

Tara Lee was walking casually dressed in her security chief uniform. She was looking around. She called it managing by walking around. She got a feel for the station, what was going on, and what her people were up to. She could sit at her desk and review all the monitors. She often did. But Tara Lee also got out and made herself known. Her people never knew when they would find her looking over their shoulders. If they were doing their jobs, all well and good. But if they were not, there would be trouble. Tara Lee was very unforgiving on the job. I wondered how unforgiving she was in her personal life.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Tara Lee,\" I called, jumping to my feet, forgetting Captain Kidd had the privacy shield activated.
=====================================================================================================

\"Tara Lee,\" I called again, stepping free of the dampening field.
===================================================================

Tara Lee turned, saw me, hesitated.
===================================

\"Tara Lee,\" I called a third time. At last I was striding toward Er.
======================================================================

Tara Lee turned back to her original course and kept walking, albeit as casually as before. I fell into step with her.
======================================================================================================================

\"Tara Lee,\" I said again, and did not know what to say next.
==============================================================

She said, \"You came aboard the station on the last shuttle.\"
==============================================================

\"Yes,\" I said, \"I had business here.\"
=========================================

\"So I noticed,\" Tara Lee said.
================================

I was stunned. Was I being watched? Why? Was Tara Lee using her position to spy on me?
======================================================================================

\"You met with that Colonel,\" Tara Lee said. \"We\'ve been watching her.\"
===========================================================================

\"Why?\" I asked. I was both surprised and curious.
===================================================

Tara Lee was silent. I suspected this was need to know and confidential and all that. Finally Tara Lee said, \"She has been acting erratically.\"
=================================================================================================================================================

\"Erratically?\" I asked.
=========================

\"Did you notice anything unusual?\" Tara Lee asked.
====================================================

Was I being questioned? Could I learn anything? Would it be damaging to Gyllian if I answered? Did I care?
==========================================================================================================

Well, I did not want to cause Gyllian any hassle. I did not bear her any ill will. I was working for her after all.
===================================================================================================================

I said, \"She is drinking more than I remember her ever doing. I suspect lots of people drink more than they should from time to time.\"
========================================================================================================================================

\"We watch the people who stagger out of places,\" Tara Lee said. \"We escort them to their quarters or their ships. We don\'t want fights, people sprawled in the corridors, people being robbed or roughed up. Any time we approach her, she sobers up immediately, is polite and very responsible. Any idea what her game is?\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"None,\" I said, wondering how I could change the subject.
===========================================================

\"She\'s the person you are working for, right?\" Tara Lee asked, continuing to scan the area as we walked together. Walking two abreast is sometimes hard on Alexandria Space Station. Walking with the Security Chief means there is no difficulty at all.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Yes,\" I said.
================

\"Thought so,\" Tara Lee said.
==============================

\"I wanted to see you,\" I said after a pause while Tara Lee talked with some folks. They seemed lost. She sent them on their way. They were lost and glad to have someone set them straight.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You\'ve made up your mind then?\" Tara Lee said.
==================================================

\"Perhaps,\" I said, not sure myself what the answer was. \"I wanted to spend some time with you in my new villa.\"
===================================================================================================================

\"A new villa?\" Tara lee stopped and stared at me.
===================================================

\"I put in a claim,\" I said, \"and paid the fee. I haven\'t had a chance to check it out. I thought you might be interested.\"
===============================================================================================================================

\"A villa? One of those stand alone places outside of the city?\"
=================================================================

\"Yes,\" I said, \"it\'s on the southern continent.\"
=====================================================

\"You\'re kidding, right?\" Tara Lee said. I had surprised her.
===============================================================

\"Not at all,\" I said. \"Can you come?\"
=========================================

Tara Lee\'s face lit up. \"Can I, really?\"
===========================================

\"Sure,\" I said. \"I will meet you at Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. When can you come?\"
=======================================================================================

\"I have time off coming,\" Tara Lee said. \"Give me thirty-six hours to arrange it.\"
======================================================================================

\"Done,\" I said.
=================

\"I have to get back to work,\" Tara Lee said.
==============================================

\"Me, too,\" I said and retraced my steps to where Captain Kidd was still sitting.
==================================================================================

\"Our shuttle is in twenty-two minutes,\" he told me.
=====================================================

\"Let\'s not be late then,\" I said.
====================================

We headed for the departure area.
=================================

-   -   ***Chapter Fourteen The Note Tamara Received***
        -----------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Author\'s Note**

This chapter belongs before the previous one. If I have the numbers right, this is Chapter Thirteen while Chapter Thirteen should be Chapter Fourteen. In any event, this chapter comes before Tara Lee\'s arrival at Ronnie\'s new villa. There may be a need to edit the chapter previous to this to say Ronnie is going to the Big Dig.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1. Tamara Gives Me Some Insight**

My flying lessons from the training flier continued. On the one hand, the flier was able to give me both verbal instructions and display helpful diagrams on the screen in front of my seat. On the other hand, it was curt in its corrections of my errors and slowness to respond. I gathered coddling its trainees, encouragement and a sense of humor were totally absent when training potential star runners. The lack of any personal connection unnerved me. All the AIs I had ever interacted with except perhaps very basic ones in a caravan had some humor and warmth programmed in. They could repeat the same instruction over and over again without sounding irritated or condescending. This was not true of the flier\'s AI. I was definitely at the bottom of my class and probably the slowest and the stupidest trainee it had ever had. But then again, I was not genetically designed and engineered to fly a craft. Nevertheless, I persisted. That wild ride with Star piloting back in the day has always stuck with me. We survived not because the AI knew what to do but because Star knew how to get as much as possible out of the flier. Star used the AI but also brought Star\'s own experience and skill to bear. I did not know if I would ever need that kind of flying in my job, but you never know.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I set down the flier myself at the Big Dig. It was very rough. The AI scolded me. I said, \"Was this a better landing than before?\"
====================================================================================================================================

\"You did not land the flier before,\" the flier said. \"I needed to override your previous landing.\"
======================================================================================================

\"Did you have to override this landing?\" I asked.
===================================================

\"No,\" the flier said truthfully. You can always depend on an AI not to hedge.
===============================================================================

\"Than its better,\" I said.
============================

\"Your logic is spurious,\" the AI pronounced. \"You need to improve in order to protect the flier\'s landing gear.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"Acknowledged,\" I said. \"I will endeavor to improve.\"
=========================================================

\"It is necessary for you to continue to be permitted to fly,\" the AI said.
============================================================================

I did not argue. The AI had a point. I did not want to damage the flier.
========================================================================

I suited up, climbed down and walked to Tamara\'s office. Always hazy, the sky looked particularly cold and I judged the clouds gathering to be Hypatian snow. It would be good to get to my new villa before the storm reached us.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m glad your here,\" Tamara said. \"Not only will everyone be glad to get the supplies, I have something to show you? Do you want a nice cup of tea?\"
==========================================================================================================================================================

\"I do,\" I said and finished taking off my environmental suit. How many hours had I logged in this suit anyway?
================================================================================================================

\"OK,\" Tamara said and went to fix it. No house bots here. Archaeologists really roughed it.
=============================================================================================

Tamara set the teapot between us. The scent of Jazmin rose from it. Tamara removed the tealeaves and poured us each a steaming cupful.
======================================================================================================================================

\"I received this note,\" Tamara said. She handed it to me on a piece of flimsy paper. I studied it. It was a series of numbers, nothing more.
==============================================================================================================================================

**Insert the code here.**
=========================

\"What is this?\" I asked.
==========================

\"That was my question,\" Tamara said, holding her mug in two hands. Her office was cool and the mug was wonderful to hold.
===========================================================================================================================

\"It came from an anonymous source but reached our communications net. I figured it was a coded message but I did not know from whom or how it got here. No one knew what to make of it.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I can\'t tell you,\" I said. \"Maybe Josh could figure it out.\"
==================================================================

\"I have figured it out,\" Tamara said. \"I just wanted to show you what we received.\"
=======================================================================================

\"What does it say and who is it from?\" I asked.
=================================================

Tamara smiled.
==============

\"Let me tell you how I figured it out,\" she said. \"The numbers all run together. There are no spaces. But something about the numbers looked familiar. I couldn\'t figure it out until I remembered that decrypting messages was a game Star and I played a long time ago. Pantherans use codes all the time but it is the AIs who encode and decode them. The Pantherans don\'t do any encrypting themselves. We were reading a story which depended on the people decoding an ancient message. The book explained how ancient human civilizations used codes. We looked up a number of encryption methods. We agreed to send each other messages in code.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara smiled to herself. \"It was a long trip from the Long John Silver Star System to the University of the Gifted Mind on Socrates. We picked a particular book and used it to encrypt and decrypt all our messages. As I looked at this message, I realized the first six numbers spelled my name in that code. That\'s why they looked so familiar. I then looked at the last few numbers. They were the ones that always spelled Star\'s name. It was the first code we ever used and from time to time we would go back and use it again just for fun.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So the message is from Captain Star Runner?\" I asked. This was good news.
============================================================================

Tamara smiled. \"Yes, it is. Star is back and Star is fine\--as least I assume so. The message does not say.\"
==============================================================================================================

\"What does it say?\" I asked.
==============================

\"It\'s about the dig,\" Tamara said. \"I don\'t know who put Star to work on this but Star has been working on some hyperspace/normal space coordinates. One set is located here in the Pharaoh Star System. The other set is located far outside the Coalition. Star did not say exactly where.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So they are the instructions for getting from here to there,\" I said.
========================================================================

\"Yes,\" Tamara said. \"Star called them ancient Pantheran designations.\"
==========================================================================

\"And Star sent them to you because\--\"
========================================

\"Because Star thinks Pantherans went from here to there.\"
===========================================================

\"Pantherans on Hypatia?\" I asked.
===================================

\"Pantherans at least in the Pharaoh Star System a long time ago,\" Tamara said.
================================================================================

\"Why?\" I asked. \"What does this mean?\"
==========================================

\"We have been continuing our excavations and research here,\" Tamara said, apparently ignoring my question. \"We\'ve been puzzled because the room with the murals is so big and the rest of the installation is so small. It did not make any sense. Nor did the murals themselves. They are very beautiful, but they are very generic. It could be any earth like planet. Then we began to wonder if that is the point.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That is the point?\" I repeated. \"Forgive me, Tamara. I don\'t know what you\'re getting at.\"
=================================================================================================

\"Art is usually specific,\" Tamara said, refreshing our tea. \"You don\'t make a statue, for example, of a horse and a rider. You make a statue of a specific horse and a specific rider. The horse does not have to be a real horse, but it needs to embody a certain spirit. The rider is not just any rider. It\'s a soldier, a king, leader of her people. The rider is wearing specific clothes\--a uniform, a crown, carrying food to hungry people. You see what I mean?\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Yes, I think so,\" I said though I was not certain at all I did.
==================================================================

\"The statue commemorates an event or looks forward to an outcome,\" Tamara continued. \"It\'s an ideal perhaps.\"
==================================================================================================================

She waited to see if I had a comment but I did not. I busied myself with my tea to cover my ignorance.
======================================================================================================

\"The mural is not specific,\" Tamara repeated. \"So I began to ask myself why would anyone go to the trouble of producing such a massive amount of art and have it both beautiful and generic.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

I pose questions all the time. I was beginning to see how this worked.
======================================================================

\"I wondered if the murals were to make the people in the room comfortable. They evoke a picture for me. I\'ve been on a beach by an ocean or on a mountain top. The pictures are not of any specific mountain top, but I can picture myself on the mountain top I\'ve visited. What if that was the point of these murals. They are familiar.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

She leaned forward. \"What if people were brought here and allowed to look at these murals in order to remind them of their home world. And not just people from one world but many worlds. The murals could help them feel more at home while they were underground on a toxic planet far from their world.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And the tunnels and small rooms were for a support staff,\" I said.
=====================================================================

\"Right,\" Tamara said. \"The people in the big room were not permanent residents.\"
====================================================================================

\"The coordinates,\" I said.
============================

\"Right,\" Tamara said. \"Bring them here and then take them somewhere else.\"
==============================================================================

\"It makes sense,\" I said. \"How can you prove it?\"
=====================================================

\"By going to where the coordinates lead,\" Tamara said.
========================================================

\"Are you going to do that?\" I asked.
======================================

\"That will depend on where the coordinates lead,\" Tamara said. \"I don\'t have an answer to that yet. I don\'t know who came here and why. I don\'t know why we don\'t have any records of this. I think the people who came here were human. I don\'t have definite proof they all were.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Other races came here?\" I asked.
===================================

\"I don\'t have any evidence of that,\" Tamara said.
====================================================

\"But the coordinates are in Pantheran,\" I said.
=================================================

\"They are an ancient Pantheran designation,\" Tamara said. \"They don\'t write them this away anymore. I\'m running a search to see when this style was abandoned, why it was abandoned and if it was ever used later.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And what is Star doing with this information?\" I asked.
==========================================================

\"I don\'t know that either,\" Tamara said. \"Here\'s what the note says:
=========================================================================

Tamara, The Race\'s ancient code for coordinates in Pharaoh Star System found paired with coordinates at extreme edge of western spiral arm. Investigating. Star
================================================================================================================================================================

\"So this might have nothing to do with your dig,\" I said, feeling quite deflated.
===================================================================================

\"That\'s also true,\" Tamara said, \"but it at least makes some sense. Nothing about this facility suggests long-term occupation. If it functioned as a staging area that might work.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you\'re still guessing,\" I said.
======================================

\"You could say it that way,\" Tamara said. \"I prefer to think These two lines of investigation might merge.\"
===============================================================================================================

I opened my moth to make a smart remark, then closed it. I could tell Tamara wanted this to be true. She wanted it to be true that she and Star were working together to solve two related mysteries. I wondered if it was clouding her judgment. Then again, what did it matter to me?
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Does Gyllian know about this?\" I asked. I sill did not have a handle on what that woman was doing and why and where all this left me.
========================================================================================================================================

\"She is the one doing the searches I told you about,\" Tamara said. \"I\'m waiting for her to get back to me.\"
================================================================================================================

\"She\'s still on the Alexandria Space Station?\" I asked.
==========================================================

\"As far as I know,\" Tamara said.
==================================

The bots had finished unloading the flier. I had finished my tea and the pot was empty. Time to go. Tara Lee was coming.
========================================================================================================================

\"Keep me informed,\" I said.
=============================

\"I w ill,\" Tamara said.
=========================

\"Say hi to Star for me if you get a chance,\" I said. Tamara had not said if she had responded to Star\'s note.
================================================================================================================

\"I will if Star gives me a way to contact,\" Tamara said. \"This message arrived with a quantum light key and no return address. Very secure but very frustrating.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================

\"So you don\'t know if it is really from Star,\" I said.
=========================================================

\"I think that is why Star use the cipher,\" Tamara said. \"The quantum light key was sufficient to encrypt the message. The cipher was to authenticate it came from Star.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================

\"OH, I see,\" I said.
======================

This was a special thing. It was between Star and Tamara. Why did I feel a prick of jealousy. Star was Tamara\'s friend, not mine. Star had been my lover. Now Tara Lee was.
============================================================================================================================================================================

Yet somehow that did not quite satisfy me.
==========================================

-   -   ***Chapter Thirteen We Spend Time At My New Villa***
        ----------------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Scene 1. The Faros Lighthouse Spaceport Cafe**

Captain Kidd and I returned to Ptolemy City via the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. We each went our separate ways. I stayed at the spaceport until readying two fliers. I instructed Star\'s raining flier to at the Alexandria Space Station to pick up Tara Lee at the appropriate time. I knew Tara Lee would not like this reminder of Captain Star Runner, but the training flier was space worthy and reliable. It would arrive in a timely fashion, negotiate docking, wait for Tara Lee and bring her safely to the villa. I recorded a message to this affect, leaving out the part about Captain Star Runner, of course. If the flier volunteered this information, so be it. If Tara Lee guessed, so be it. I did not want to be deceitful or devious.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The personal flier that Josh and I brought from the villa\--it definitely needed a name\--received the supplies I ordered as soon as I climbed aboard the shuttle craft. Josh confirmed the house AI reported an ample stock of food stuffs and other household items. I had perishable goods brought in. The hydroponic tanks were empty. I would have to work out how to revitalize them. In the meantime, we could run over to Star\'s villa. Those tanks were now operational. I made sure items Tara Lee liked were available and laid in some special items for our enjoyment. Finally, I launched several coded searches on the political situation inside and outside the Coalition. I also did a deep background check on Gyllian. It felt invasive but I needed to know. Finally, after consulting with the team via chat, I sent a query to the Fungusian Network on the same two subjects. They might or might not respond. In the years I have been dealing with them, their helpfulness varies. They do not always choose to respond with anything I could not find elsewhere.

This done, I sat down to eat something and wait to depart.
==========================================================

This gave me time to insider what had happened aboard Alexandria Space Station.
===============================================================================

I updated my notes and jotted down my reflections.
==================================================

-   -   -   ### **From the Notes of Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell**

As far as we could tell, no word of the Big Dig had slipped out. This did not mean it had not. It only meant we did not know about it. Denise Kahlil\'s presence on Hypatia was troubling and her connection to the Pantheran General Secretary\'s office (Note to self: flesh this out a bit more. I said she was passing information to the Pantherans but I need to be more specific. The General Secretary is the executive of the Coalition. The General Secretary works with the Assembly of the Races which passes legislation for the General Secretary to put into practice, or not, as the General Secretary see fit. The General Secretary is always an ungendered Pantheran whose appointment is confirmed by the Assembly of the Races. No assembly has ever refused to confirm a Pantheran appointee. In addition, it is important to mention that the Pantherans do not send any representatives to the Assembly of the Races. They are not equal partners. Their role is clearly that of caretaker and benevolent overlord. In practice, the Coalition is more feudal than democratic while pretending to be the latter.)
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

As usual, I wanted to go beyond my contract to the bigger picture of what was going on and to try to affect the outcome to make the situation better. This seemed highly unlikely. The Coalition included thousands of worlds. I could not remember the number. I learned it in school. A quick consult with my link would give me the exact number. It did not matter. What mattered was the sheer size and intricacy of this particular problem.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Back to Denise Kahlil. Questions:
=================================

1.  Why was she working for the Secretary General\'s office?
    ========================================================

2.  What new information did she have?
    ==================================

3.  What information had she passed on already?
    ===========================================

4.  How was her death being treated here on Hypatia , inside the Solar League and at the Solar League Examiner?
    ===========================================================================================================

5.  Would another reporter be dispatched and would this one be clean?
    =================================================================

I sent out more queries and contacted my team members.
======================================================

6.  Was Cuthbert more involved or was he only a supplier of information?
    ====================================================================

7.  What had he passed to Kahlil previously?
    ========================================

8.  Did Cuthbert know anything else about the base that Juliet Maxwell did not know?
    ================================================================================

If we had a better picture, our listening might be improved. This sifting for data was more complicated than I originally envisioned.
=====================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. Josh Comes to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport Cafe**

\"Hey Kiddo,\" Josh said, sliding into the booth across from me.
================================================================

Startled, I looked up from my notes.
====================================

\"What\'s up?\" I asked. \"Why are you here?\"
==============================================

\"I found some stuff,\" Josh said, using one of the privacy shields. I had forgotten to order one of those. I ordered several to be delivered here as soon as possible.
=======================================================================================================================================================================

Josh ordered food and drink, applying it to my tab. Business was business.
==========================================================================

\"OK,\" he said. \"I finally got those flash drives unencrypted. It was hard, but I have enough skill to do it without resorting to contacting the Fungusian Network. It is a matter of pride, you know.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

I did know. josh was pretty easy going but he wanted everyone to know what a good hacker, in the good sense of the word, he was.
================================================================================================================================

\"And,\" I said after a moment of awesome wonder at his abilities.
==================================================================

\"Cuthbert\'s drive was not too interesting,\" Josh said, \"except for one or two facts he held back from Juliet. From what I could tell, he only shared information with Juliet to impress her.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And hold her hostage,\" I said. \"She was desperate for the information and therefore did not stand up to his abuse.\"
========================================================================================================================

\"Right,\" Josh said, sliding away from that nasty episode. \"The facts he held back was an estimate of the number of people that large room with the murals held and the estimate of how many people occupied the tunnels.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Is that important?\" I asked.
===============================

\"I don\'t know. It\'s just odd,\" Josh said. \"That room held about two thousand people. He estimates the tunnels held around four hundred.\"
==============================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s odd,\" I said.
========================

\"I thought so,\" Josh said.
============================

\"Does he have an explanation?\" I asked.
=========================================

\"No, not on his drive,\" Josh said. \"It\'s merely a report of estimates. Maybe speculation was above his pay grade.\"
=======================================================================================================================

\"I wouldn\'t think so,\" I said. \"It wouldn\'t be above Tamara\'s pay grade or even Juliet\'s.\"
==================================================================================================

\"That\'s what I thought,\" Josh said. \"I haven\'t contacted them.\"
=====================================================================

\"I\'ll speak with them myself. What did you find on Kahlil\'s drive?\" I asked, not getting diverted onto my plans for the next couple of days.
================================================================================================================================================

\"There are messages from the Secretary General\'s office, from the Secretary General himself,\" Josh said. He was awed by this. Although Hypatia was outside the Coalition, the Secretary General was the highest position we knew about. Because the Secretary General is an ungendered Pantheran, I knew there were powerful individuals to whom it reported, but we never saw them. These were the gendered rulers of Panthera.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Say more,\" I said.
=====================

\"There is a lot of verbiage about saving the Coalition and protecting all the races,\" Josh said. \"It\'s pretty heavy stuff. From her notes, it looks like Kahlil believed she was working to save the Coalition from those who were planning to tear it apart. She saw herself as a patriot working against the evil forces of fragmentation and rebellion represented by the Northern Frontier and the Consortium of Planets. The Secretary General points out that the Coalition is making sure the Coalition worlds don\'t become like the Republic of Space or Queensland or even the Seven Worlds of Faith. It\'s all the persuasive stuff.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We\'ve been hearing it all our lives,\" I said. \"I no longer know what is real and true and what is propaganda. This case is all very confusing. Looking at it this way, Gyllian, Tamara and Emily Dickinson are the enemies of good order and safety.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Precisely,\" Josh said. \"And maybe they are. Maybe we\'re working for the wrong side.\"
==========================================================================================

Do you believe that?\" I asked.
===============================

\"Mostly no,\" Josh said uneasily. \"But there is a part of me that believes all the hype. I want to be safe. I don\'t want military actions. I don\'t want the Pantherans bombing the southern continent even if we wouldn\'t be affected here in Ptolemy City. I don\'t want the feeling the Pantherans can come in any time they please and interfere.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Isn\'t that the case?\" I asked. \"What is stopping them?\"
=============================================================

And there it was. Either way, we were dependent on Pantheran restraint. The only way we could counter the Pantherans were if we mounted a western spiral arm wide revolt and that was unlikely. And if we did, who would maintain the jump gates? Would we be putting ourselves back to the way it was during the First Space Expansion? Whole planets would starve or go back to a a commercial and industrial system which could no longer depend on space flight and the interchange between planets and races. How long before the neural net failed? Each planet would become its own world with no outside interaction. \"The problem with this whole situation is,\" I said, \"there are no good guys and no bad guys. There is something to be said for each position.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I just hope the Pantherans leave the Pharaoh Star System alone,\" Josh said. \"There might be more opportunities for me in the Solar League, but that\'s why I stay here. I don\'t want to gt involved.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

I did not know this about Josh. He had a lot of ambition but it was tempered by the realities of living inside the Coalition. As for me, I liked living here and had no desire ever to leave.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

My searches came back. There was so much available on the political situation. I off-loaded it to The Czarina, asking her to summarize. She was a veteran watcher and listener. She would know how to sift and what was important and what was not.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I was still waiting for the search to complete about Gillian.
=============================================================

The flier signaled me. It was fully loaded and ready to go.
===========================================================

\"Anything else?\" I asked.
===========================

\"No,\" Josh said.
==================

\"I\'m off then,\" I said.
==========================

\"Have fun,\" Josh said.
========================

\"I intend to,\" I said.
========================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. I Review the Information on Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo**

It was a little spooky coming into the new villa. The last time I did that Emily Dickinson was there and there were two dead bodies before the hearth. I chatted wig the AI. It was obsequious and I changed the setting to helpful and a bit chatty as I was alone. It accepted the change without comment. Josh had done a good job setting it up for customization, privacy and security. Remembering Star\'s penshent for recording everything, I checked all the cameras on its network, giving Jacques specific directives about what was to be saved and when.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I parked the flier in the underground garage? Hanger? Star would call it a ride park. When would I ever stop thinking about Star. Star had been gone for over four years now. Tara Lee was funny, sexy and beautiful.She would be arriving soon.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The ramp from the underground parking garage led upward. I asked Jacques to direct me to the bedroom area. He suggested the owner\'s suite. That sounded like a reasonable place to start.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

Reasonable was not a proper adjective. Over the top might be a better one\--deep plush carpets, thick draperies, mirrors, mirrors, mirrors! A bed with more controls than I thought I could ever master. The clothes had been removed and recycled. The closet space was vast. The tub with its sprays and temperature settings would be fun to splash around in. I knew Tara Lee would know just how to make it pleasurable. Her repertoire of lovemaking scenarios seemed endless. I had never made up my mind if this meant she was inventive, well-schooled on videos or well-traveled. I never asked. A smile came to my face looking at the pool of bubbling water. I could get in this pool with Tara Lee and be swept away. We would laugh and kiss and do all sorts of things I asked Jacques not to record unless we specifically asked him to. Star would never even get near anything like this. Star was through and through cat when it came to water.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I unpacked myself, deciding where my things would go and where Tara lee\'s things would go. I wandered into the food preparation area. It was not called a kitchen. Apparently this area was designed for someone who actually knew how to prepare food. I checked the stock of the prep machine. My choices were there. I gave Jacques instructions for contacting Star\'s villa AI so that my plan for re-invigorating the hydroponic growing tanks could get started.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I was just thinking about settling down before the simulated fire in the hearth when my link signaled my search on information about Gyllian was complete. I retrieved my food and drink from the prepper and carried it into the hearth room. It was spotless. You would never know two people died here. For all I knew, more people than that had died here. The list of weapons stored in this villa was staggering.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The viewer scrolled at a comfortable reading rate. It took too much brain power to read inside my head and the implanting of information in the brain was still very imperfect. Old-fashioned reading was quicker and still more accurate for me. I could have the link integrate the information into my case file. I munched and read.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian Anselma Romeres Lujo was born on Socrates.
==================================================

Interesting. She was born on the Northern Frontier. Her roots were not in the Solar League.
===========================================================================================

Her parents were professors. After her studies at the University of the Gifted Mind, she enrolled in Intelligence Branch of the Solar League Navy, receiving training and a commission.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================

Her biography listed the spaceships she served on, her awards and a few missions she was a part of. As much of this material was classified, the missions listed were rescue and recovery operations.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

She was married to Lieutenant Eberhard Dietrich, also known as Emily Dickinson.
===============================================================================

No kidding. That was odd. I could not picture them together. But then I always had trouble picturing a man and a woman together. It is just how my mind works\--or doesn\'t work.
=================================================================================================================================================================================

The marriage did not last. It was a contract marriage and neither party sought to renew it.
===========================================================================================

After that, Gyllian moved back to the Northern Frontier and applied to the Ministry of Defense in the newly formed Consortium of Planets. She was given the rank of First Lieutenant. Her first big accomplishment was protecting all spacecraft from the Bermuda Triangle.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I remembered that was Star\'s first adventure. I looked at the date. Star and Gyllian went back a long way. Not as far as Gyllian and Emily Dickinson, but more than twelve years. I had still be in high school. Then again, that made Star only about fifteen or sixteen years old. I remembered Star had no idea how long a star runner lived. The older ones were always terminated. I suspected Pantherans lived a long time\--at least the gendered ones did.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The bio went on, but photo opportunities and awards were not what I was interested in.
======================================================================================

The final paragraph caught my attention.
========================================

For some time, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo has been crusading for the Consortium of Planets, in cooperation with the Solar League, to be skeptical of Coalition claims of neutrality toward the non-Pantheran races. She maintains that the Pantheran agenda is to subjugate the other races and establish its hegemony in the western spiral arm. Her activities, although widely supported by the Consortium of Planets upper echelons privately, is problematic for its public image of wanting to cooperate with the Coalition to reopen borders between the Coalition and the Northern Frontier. More advanced planets are trying to develop a closer relationship with their counterparts in the Solar League and like-minded planets of other races. Her biggest support comes from more frontier planets deeper inside the northern territory. Her dismissal from the Ministry of Defense is seen as a victory for the moderates and a setback to the ore radical elements. Some documents suggest, however, that highly positioned people in the government agree with her and this dismissal is only a public relations move. Colonel Gyllian Romeres may still be employed by the Intelligence Branch and is working undercover in plain sight.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Bingo! I turned off the viewer with a wave of my hand. Gyllian was only playing at being fired. No wonder she was publicly drinking and then taking the drugs to sober up quickly. She probably had the drugs embedded subcutaneously. The Consortium of Planets believed Tamara\'s Big Dig was a major piece of the puzzle. I wondered what it was. Over two thousand people could be accommodated in the room with the generic murals. Only four hundred and fifty could Liv in the tunnels. How did that work?
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I puzzled over these items during the next day, reading The Czarina\'s reports and looking forward to Tara Lee\'s arrival in the evening. The training flier signaled its departure from Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. It signaled again when it docked with the Alexandria Space Station. Finally, it signaled its departure from the Alexandria Space Station with Tara Lee on board.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I prepared my body carefully. I certainly had ever aid known to human beings in my suite. I chose my clothes carefully. Lee knowing flashy. I wanted to be rough and ready Ronnie, smelling of cleanness, but under that casual outer presentation, I wanted to be ready for her touch.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I met Tara Lee in the underground parking garage. The flier\'s door popped open. Tara Lee climbed out, graceful as ever.I opened my arms and she came to me, sweet smelling and warm, her mouth hot on mine. We held that pose for a long time.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"MMM,\" I said. \"It\'s good to have you back where you belong.\"
==================================================================

Tara Lee flushed.
=================

\"That was good,\" she said.
============================

Then she looked around her.
===========================

\"My bags,\" she said.
======================

\"Already on their way to our suite,\" I said.
==============================================

\"That flier was amazing,\" Tara Lee said. \"I asked it for make and model, but the answer I got was garbled.\"
===============================================================================================================

\"Garbled?\" I asked. That did not sound right.
===============================================

\"Just some shrieks and growling noises,\" Tara Lee said. \"It sounded like a file had been badly corrupted.\"
==============================================================================================================

I laughed. \"No, just not translated,\" I said. \"The flier answered you.\"
===========================================================================

\"What language could it possibly be?\" Tara Lee asked. \"I\'ve never heard anything like it.\"
===============================================================================================

\"Pantheran,\" I said, \"specifically, star runner Pantheran. That flier was once a star runner training ride. It was re purposed and given to a Pantheran agent known on Hypatia at Richard III, Duke of the Gloucester Road. It was outfitted to be used by a human being\--the displays and verbal inputs and outputs. On a very wild run\--which I won\'t go into\--Captain Star Runner discovered it was of Pantheran design and re-established its star runner interface. The two of them discovered the flier had been Star\'s trainer. They got on famously. Star claimed the flier and made more human adaptations so I could fly it\--I use that word loosely. I still have access to the flier. I keep it because it can fly with the Pharaoh Star System. So, I could use it to fetch you here directly\--no going to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport, no renting a flier, no going from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere and halfway around the planet. We\'re down under big time here.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A shadow passed over Tara Lee\'s face. Star again. I brought her into a rough embrace, kissing her hard.
========================================================================================================

\"Don\'t fret, my lovely,\" I said. \"it\'s just a flier and it brought you to me as quickly as you could get away. That\'s all that matters.\"
===============================================================================================================================================

I thought she might pull away, might shake her finger at me and admonish me. I thought at least she would find my behavior oafish or too mannish. Instead, she melted into my arms.
===================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Hungry?\" I asked her when I released her.
============================================

\"Yes,\" she said, \"but not for food.\"
========================================

I smiled wickedly. \"Come with me,\" I said, taking her hand. \"This is the place of your sexiest dreams.I\'ll show you what I\'ve got. You show me how to use it.\"
====================================================================================================================================================================

I was bold, expansive, directing her moves. Tara Lee fell into step with me. She seemed shy, less sure of herself. I felt both buoyed up by my behavior and foolish. I brought her to the suite and showed her the bubbling pool. Timidly she asked for some supplies. I hesitated but Jacques the AI did not hesitate.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Is that your house AI?\" Tara Lee asked.
==========================================

\"Yes,\" I said.
================

\"He\'s so cute,\" Tara Lee said. \"I love his accent. Are you recording this?\"
================================================================================

\"Do you want me to?\" I asked. \"I turned all the recording off for privacy.\"
===============================================================================

Tara Lee giggled. \"Turn it on. I want to watch later in bed.\"
===============================================================

I gave Jacques the instructions. Tara Lee was right. It was fun watching what we did later in bed. It was more fun doing it all over again on dry land.
=======================================================================================================================================================

I whisked off her outer clothes,marveling at her underwear. I slid my softened by oils hands over it, holding her away from me to admire, pulling her close to me to feel her skin and the clothing against my body.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee by stages undressed me. Finally we stepped into the steaming pool with its foaming bubbles and perfumed oils. We totally immersed ourselves, sliding our now slick bodies against each other, giggling and laughing, playing silly games and engaging in passionate foreplay. My fingers and tongue had the run of her body and her fingers and tongue of mine.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

At last we were ready to go all the way. Was it good? What do you think? We showered, washing each other\'s body and hair. I combed hers out. Tara Lee pinned it up. Mine was short and would dry quickly. Wrapped in scrumptious robes and slippers, we stopped by the prepper and brought our food into the hearth room. Jacques had a low-burning fire going. We sat on large cushions and fed each other pieces from our plates. I sprawled, legs apart, hands clasped behind my neck. I was sleepy and sated with food and Tara Lee.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee sat cross-legged on a large cushion. She ran a finger up the inside of my thigh. \"Naughty girl,\" she said. \"You\'re letting parts of you show.\"
============================================================================================================================================================

what are you going to do about it?\" I asked.
=============================================

\"This,\" she said and touched a most private part.
===================================================

I had been so happy with Tara Lee. I had lived in the moment, enjoying her, being satisfied with her, wanting these moments to last a lifetime. I felt at home in my body and at home with hers. Although I had not really thought about it critically, I did not think anyone else could make me this happy and at peace. But in that moment of feeling the tip of her finger touch me in that way, I thought of Star\'s tongue doing the same thing and how much I wanted her finger to be rough and warm and moist the way Star\'s tongue was. She did not have whiskers to rub against me there or the gentle prick of sharp teeth or the wideness of a Pantheran\'s mouth to kiss me.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I groaned. Tara Lee took it to be encouragement and proceeded. But it was a different kind of groan. This was the groan of inner distress. Where was Star? Why had I ever sent Star away. I groaned again and Tara Lee\'s touches grew more insistent.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

My body did not betray me thankfully. It responded to her touch and I put my thoughts of Star away and lived again in the moment. I heard Tara Lee\'s squeals of pleasure as I satisfied her. We fell asleep entangled on the pillows. We did not wake until my link\'s insistent call and Jacques\'s insistent prompting woke us both.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What is it?\" Tara Lee asked sleepily. I imaged she was used to emergencies while she was sleeping. She must be erg tired. Well, so was I and sore, too, for that matter. I would need to apply those creams I saw in the medicine chest to a number of sensitive areas. I suspected Tara Lee would apply them, too.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What is it?\" Tara Lee asked again, sitting up.
=================================================

\"Trouble,\" I said. \"Three Pantheran warships have extracted way out of the Pharaoh Star System, beyond the jump gate. Gyllian, Colonel Romeres Lujo, thinks they did not use the gate intentionally but found a nearby extraction point. It\'s a very conservative move.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Pantheran warships, here in the Pharaoh Star System,\" Tara lee gasped. \"I need to get back to my post.\"
============================================================================================================

\"The warships have signaled the Alexandria Space Station they are not docking,\" I said \"and for commercial and pleasure traffic to avoid their trajectory to the southern continent of Hypatia,\" I said. \"Gyllian says they\'re after the Big Dig. If they\'re after the dig, this villa will doubtless be destroyed.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What will they do?\" Tara Lee asked.
======================================

\"Bomb it out of exigence,\" I said.
====================================

\"But your investment,\" Tara Lee exclaimed.
============================================

\"Is both insured and within the period of time I can disclaim it,\" I said.\"Sad, but true. Gyllian wants to know if I can evacuate the dig.\"
===============================================================================================================================================

\"Can you?\" Tara Lee asked.
============================

\"Jacques,\" I said, \"how many people can fit in my fliers? Include the base\'s flier in your calculations. I need to evacuate everyone. Is it possible?\"
===========================================================================================================================================================

Jacques said, \"All can fit on the fliers specified and they can lift. They will not be able to travel to Ptolemy City.\"
=========================================================================================================================

\"Can they make Sat\'s villa?\" I asked. \"They\'ll need to go over the Ring of Volcanoes. Will Star\'s villa be safe?\"
========================================================================================================================

\"Yes,\" Jacques replied. \"It is reinforced.
=============================================

\"And this villa?\" I asked. \"Is it reinforced?\" I had not considered this possibility.
=========================================================================================

\"It is,\" Jacques said, \"but the available information on Pantheran bombs suggest it will not survive in tact.\"
==================================================================================================================

\"Make the fliers ready. Dispatch all but one to the big dig. Send a message to Tamara. Have her confirm.\"
===========================================================================================================

\"All done,\" Jacques replied.
==============================

\"I\'ll do what I can with the villa when this is over,\" I told the AI.
========================================================================

\"Thank you,\" Jacques replied. \"I will put everything in lock down mode. You need to take certain items with you. I will put them in the flier.\"
===================================================================================================================================================

\"OK,\" I said. Tara Lee and I ran to the bedroom suite, got dressed and hurried to the two-seater sports flier. Bots came behind us with our bags and set them aboard. We strapped in and the little flier left the underground parking garage, lifted into the sky and turned south.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Where are we going?\" Tara lee asked.
=======================================

\"Through a volcanic mountain range called the Ring of Fire,\" I said. \"It is quite spectacular and very rugged. The flight will be bumpy. After that, we will go to the South Pole. I have access to Captain Star Runner\'s villa. That\'s a long story, but at the moment it\'s the best shot we have for survival.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

While we headed toward the volcanoes which circled the planet at this latitude, Tara Lee contacted the Alexandria Space Station and explained that her current location and situation precluded her prompt return. She would come back as soon as possible. Apparently the station manager was not taking this well. Tara Lee slapped a gesture to turn off her link.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Stupid man,\" she said. \"I don\'t have access to a space worthy flier. I am in a danger zone. What does he expect me to do, fly by flapping my arms?\"
=========================================================================================================================================================

The flight through the volcanoes was as scary and as spectacular as my previous flights.
========================================================================================

\"It\'s too bad the atmosphere is toxic,\" Tara Lee said. \"These mountains would be excellent to climb.\"
==========================================================================================================

\"You would climb them?\" I was shocked.
========================================

\"Oh, yes,\" Tara Lee said. \"It would be only for experts. You would need to mount quite an operation. I wonder if extreme climbers would be interested. The toxicity would be an added risk.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You would be crazy,\" I said.
===============================

Tara Lee smiled for the first time. \"That is the point of extreme sports,\" she said. \"You have to be crazy\--and well-prepared.\"
====================================================================================================================================

We arrived at the villa. When we came into the large open area used as living space, I smelled the plants. The tanks were revitalized. Yes. That would help a lot. The AI reported a full pantry, too. Excellent. WE settled down to wait for the others.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Chapter Fifteen The Bronze Spaceship
====================================

I sniffed the air. The smell of plants growing. The air was freshly scrubbed. The villa was comfortably warm. This was odd. Usually the villa\'s systems did not power up for occupation unless I sent a message. I had not sent a message. So why\--
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A new odor penetrated my nostrils. I could see the expression of distaste cross Tara Lee\'s face. I knew that scent. A Pantheran was present. The only Pantheran I thought could access this villa was Captain Star Runner.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I called out, \"Star, are you here?\"
=====================================

The expression of distaste stayed on Tara Lee\'s face.
======================================================

Then there Star was, filling the arch of the living area.
=========================================================

Tara Lee gasped. Concerned, I turned toward her.
================================================

\"Magnificent,\" she whispered. \"No wonder you can\'t forget.\"
================================================================

I squeezed her hand. I loved her, too. I might think of Star\'s rough tongue when Tara Lee touched me, but I could not walk away from her.
==========================================================================================================================================

\"Hello, Star,\" I said. \"This is Tara Lee O\'Rourke, Chief Security Office for the Alexandria Space Station and my lover.\"
=============================================================================================================================

I surprised both Tara Lee and myself.
=====================================

\"Greetings,\" Star said in Star\'s neutral voice. When Star speaks, there is always the hint of meow as Star forms the sounds necessary for human speech. As far as I know, humans cannot speak Pantheran.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I am pleased you brought the training flier so promptly,\" Star said, getting right down to business. Not even a whisker twitched in my direction. I wondered if memories of me had been placed in Star\'s memory archives. I was hurt. I thought there would be a special greeting for me if we finally met again.I had longed for this day for years. Now that it had come, I was unsure. Star\'s manner did not brook any discussion.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I am having the bots clean your flier and park the flier out of the way,\" Star continued. \"They found personal luggage but they also found some other items.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

\"The AI at my villa said they were important,\" I said.
========================================================

\"We will need to have a full compliment on board,\" Star said. \"I need to know if the items are important to bring along.\"
=============================================================================================================================

\"I have no idea,\" I said.
===========================

\"May I open them? Would you be willing to give the bots the code. They can reseal them and provide fresh codes,\" Star said.
=============================================================================================================================

\"We should be present when the boxes are unlocked,\" Tara Lee said, her security training coming to the fore.
==============================================================================================================

\"Proceed,\" Star said.
=======================

\"Where are we going?\" I asked.
================================

\"Initially to Alexandria Space Station,\" Star said. \"Then we will pursue the course I have been researching for Tamara\'s project. Do you want to accompany us? I understand you are working for her.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"For Gyllian actually,\" I said.
=================================

\"As am I,\" Star said. \"Given the appearance of the military, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo will be on board for this mission.\"
=================================================================================================================================

\"I have my responsibilities at the station especially with the warships present in the system,\" Tara Lee said.
================================================================================================================

I hesitated. Where did my loyalties lie?
========================================

\"You do not need to decide immediately,\" Star told me. \"When we dock at the Alexandria Space Station, we will all disembark. Those wishing to accompany me into Mother Space will proceed quickly to my ride. We have little time to affect an insertion. We await Tamara\'s crew. I am grateful you had fliers to dispatch.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Still very cold.
================

\"The boxes,\" Star prompted.
=============================

\"Right,\" I said. Tara Lee and I hurried back to the parking area.
===================================================================

\"I\'ve never been that close to a Pantheran before,\" Tara Lee said. \"That color! hat coat! It must be\--\" She trailed off, embarrassed. I created several endings to her sentence in my mind:
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   touch it.
    =========

-   be held by it.
    ==============

-   make love to it.
    ================

\"Yes,\" I said. All were true.
===============================

\"No wonder you\'ve been so stuck on it,\" Tara Lee said with amazement.
========================================================================

\"Yes,\" I said. My responses sounded so inadequate, but we were hurrying and there were decisions to make.
===========================================================================================================

\"Though it doesn\'t seem to pay much attention to you,\" Tara Lee added with satisfaction.
===========================================================================================

\"The memories may have been archived,\" I said. \"Or Star is focused on the current task. Star\'s mind interacts with Star\'s AI at a very intimate level.
===========================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee grasped my hand.
=========================

\"I liked you calling me your lover,\" she said.
================================================

\"You are,\" I said, squeezing back.
====================================

\"It\'s never been like it was back at your villa before,\" Tara Lee said.
==========================================================================

\"No, it hasn\'t,\" I agreed.
=============================

We reached the sport flier. I spoke to the nearest bot, \"You have boxes for me to look at.\"
=============================================================================================

\"Over here,\" it said.
=======================

They were lock boxes, many of them. I opened several. They were filled with currency. Tara Lee and I exchanged looks. The villa had once belonged to Adam Worth who was under indictment in the Solar League.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It\'s yours,\" Tara Lee said. \"Lock it up No one can prove otherwise.\"
==========================================================================

\"Star,\" I said, looking directly at the bot, \"will items here be safe from the bombing?\"
============================================================================================

\"Yes,\" Star said. \"You can store those items safely under your codes.\"
==========================================================================

My link acknowledged a receipt from Star for the correct number of boxes. I had not opened them all. Unless there was a compelling reason, Star would not tamper with them. Star had said nothing about me accessing the villa.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I accepted the receipt. I returned with Tara Lee to the living area.
====================================================================

The first of the Big Dig transported personnel arrived. Te fliers were packed with people and equipment. Star and the bots sorted them out. Tara Lee and I directed the household bots to serve them. There was much anxiety until the final flier with Tamara on board arrived. I saw her throw her arms around Star\'s neck. It was an a very intimate moment. Tara Lee was watching, too.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee said, \"They love each other.\"
========================================

\"Very much,\" I said.
======================

\"Aren\'t you jealous?\" Tara Lee asked.
========================================

\"At first,\" I said, remembering a previous reunion. \"But their relationship is quite unique. Star calls Tamara my friend. Star looks up to her though curiously enough, Star was Tamara\'s guardian. I think Tamara plays the role of advisor and explainer. Each in their own way looks out for one another. They are more family than anything else.\"
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Interesting,\" Tara Lee said.
===============================

\"Quite,\" I said. \"Tamara is not a threat. If she disapproved of someone, that probably would be the end of it.\"
===================================================================================================================

\"And she approved of you?\" Tara Lee asked.
============================================

\"As far as I know,\" I said. This was conversation was getting very weird.
===========================================================================

\"It\'s hard to think of him as female,\" Tara Lee said. \"I\'m wondering about that.\"
=======================================================================================

\"You didn\'t first see Star prancing across the lobby at Shepheard\'s Hotel draped in a filmy scarf,\" I said. \"Both Star and the scarf were lighter than air.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================

Tara Lee frowned, thinking.
===========================

\"I think I can imagine that,\" she said. \"Right now he looks so solid. But a cat can be light on its feet. Like that?\"
=========================================================================================================================

\"Like that,\" I said \"only more so.\"
=======================================

\"A stereotype, for sure,\" Tara Lee said, \"but like a dancer.\"
=================================================================

\"Exactly,\" I said. \"They were the movements of a very special woman. Sometimes you move like that, too.\"
============================================================================================================

\"Then I\'ll have to invest in some scarves,\" Tara Lee said, laughing.
=======================================================================

I smiled. \"A few scarves and nothing else might do it,\" I agreed.
===================================================================

Star called us to the training flier, motioning Tara Lee and I to stay back. The staff boarded, then Tamara, then Tara Lee and me. Star strapped into the acceleration web awkwardly. I sat in the human pilot\'s seat, Tamara and Tara Lee behind me. I looked at the display, Tara Lee and Tamara looking over my shoulder. All lights were barely green when we began to move. Star said nothing. All communication with the flier was in Star\'s head. We saw the results on the display.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A message flashed up:
=====================

Prepare for extreme G forces.
=============================

Star was pushing the flier to move quickly. Were the bombs falling at this moment?
==================================================================================

I relayed the message to the passengers. I wondered how to prepare myself.
==========================================================================

The G force was horrible. I felt I was being rolled over by a heavy object. I was certain I would be sick or pass out. The feeling lasted a long time. There were no medical monitors to see how any of us were doing. I wondered how Star determined the maximum G force to maintain to get to the space station quickly while not killing any of us.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The G forces abated. We were very close to the docking area. This was not the pleasant area where the shuttle craft or the Shuttle passenger liners docked. This was where the suppliers docked. The flier moved expertly. I heard the thump and bump as we filled our birth.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Here we were and I had not had time to decide if I wanted to go with Star into hyperspace or join Tara Lee on the space station and find out what was going on with the warships and the bombing.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star unstrapped quickly and bounded out of the flier, saying nothing to anyone. I assumed Star needed to get to Star\'s spaceship at soon as possible to be ready to blast off again.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================

I unstrapped myself and moved to the hatch. First in, first out. That was the rule of fliers.
=============================================================================================

Gyllian was standing there.
===========================

\"Ronnie,\" she said without preamble or greeting, \"I hope you can come with us. Josh, Captain Kidd and The Czarina are here. They\'re waiting at the ship.\" She took my arm. \"Please join us.\"
===================================================================================================================================================================================================

If the rest of my team was already on board figuratively if not literally, how could I back down?
=================================================================================================

Tara Lee said in my ear, \"Go. I have work to do. I\'ll be here when you get back.\"
====================================================================================

\"Count on it,\" I said though I wondered what I meant.
=======================================================

I let Gyllian propel me out of the docking area and through the space station. I wondered where Star was parked.
================================================================================================================

The signage indicated we were in a secure area. This was where the space yachts parked. It gave Star\'s ship some privacy.
==========================================================================================================================

The ship surprised me. It was a bronze disc, not a torch ship like all of Star\'s other ships. We filed aboard. The interior was luxurious even if cramped. Tamara, Gyllian, Juliet and I ended up sharing a compartment for two.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Prepare to disembark,\" Star said over the intercom.
======================================================

\"Disembark from the space station? We had barely gotten aboard.
================================================================

Yet embark we did. The G forces were high. Star wanted to get to the insertion point as quickly as possible. The warships must be very close.
=============================================================================================================================================

In my near blackout state, I heard Star\'s voice say, \"We have inserted into hyperspace. The G forces will decrease. Perform medical scans. Then you may be free to move about.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================

It took a while before I could move sufficiently to sit up and look about me. Tamara was kneeling next to Juliet who was crying. Gyllian was standing at the medical scanner.
=============================================================================================================================================================================

\"You\'re next,\" Gyllian said to me.
=====================================

I struggled to get off the bed and in front of the scanner. Lights blinked green. The readouts were still blurry. I could look them over later, even repeat the scan. For now, it was sufficient that I had come through two high G flights in tact.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"She\'s okay, I think,\" Tamara said, rising. \"She\'s just scared.\"
======================================================================

\"Understandable,\" Gyllian said, her hand on the door latch.
=============================================================

\"Where are we going?\" I asked.
================================

\"We think we are going where the people on Hypatia went,\" Gyllian said.
=========================================================================

There was more to it than that. I needed to talk with Star. Gyllian would not tell me what I wanted to know. Besides, I wanted to know what had happened to Star after Star left the western spiral arm and why Star was subtly different. That was why I had not rushed to Star. This was not exactly my Star.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Sixteen I Receive More Background***
        -----------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Author\'s Note**

Shoot. I forgot to put in scenes in the previous chapter. Let\'s see. What would they be? I\'ll have to combine a bit for simplicity.
=====================================================================================================================================

Scene 1. Ronnie and Tara Lee Meet Someone at the Villa
======================================================

Scene 2. A Wild Ride to the Alexandria Space Station and Beyond
===============================================================

Scene 3. Aboard the Bronze Disc Starship
========================================

That should do it and get me to Star\'s recap.
==============================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1. I Talk with Captain Star Runner**

I followed Gyllian out of the door of the state room. By the time the door closed behind me, she was nowhere to be seen. I wondered where the star runner\'s area was. Guessing that this spaceship would be set up something like *The Owl and the Pussy Cat*, I said aloud, \"Christabel, how do I get to the runner\'s area?\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Familiar blue lights appeared. I followed them down one corridor after another. I found a ramp and followed it upward. The lights blinked out behind me. At last I stepped into a circular room. My sense of interior geography is poor but I suspected I was at the center of the saucer-shaped starship underneath a dome.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star lay unmoving on a rectangular platform in the center of the room. Star appeared to be asleep. I would have thought Star was dead except I could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest and hear his breathing. Encircling both Star and the rectangular platform was a fuchsia-colored shimmer.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Star,\" I said aloud.
=======================

\"Hello, Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell,\" Star said, shifting a little and opening green eyes.
=======================================================================================================

You\'re not in your acceleration web,\" I said. I was stating the obvious but I did not understand.
===================================================================================================

\"This replaces the acceleration web,\" Star said, gesturing about. \"You can walk through the field around me. It won\'t hurt you though it may feel a little strange.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

Will you walk into my parlour?\" said the Spider to the Fly,\" I quoted Mary Howitt.
====================================================================================

\"\'Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy;\" Star quoted back to me.
=====================================================================================

The poem broke the tension between us. I stepped into the fuchsia-colored shimmer. Star was right. It tingled. It was like being probed, like touching something electrical, but not painful. As I stood next to the rectangular platform, the tingling sensation lessened though it did not totally go away.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"What is it?\" I asked.
========================

\"You can sit down,\" Star said, indicating the platform. I did. Nothing else happened to me.
=============================================================================================

\"What is it?\" I asked again.
==============================

\"Part of the infrastructure of this ride,\" Star said. \"It meshes with my systems and with the ride.\"
========================================================================================================

\"You seem different,\" I said. It was nothing I could point to. It was, nevertheless, true.
============================================================================================

\"I am,\" Star said. \"I received what was called a significant software upgrade. It reached down to the molecular level I\'m told.\"
=====================================================================================================================================

I thought about this. It sounded radical and scary.
===================================================

\"Who did that?\" I asked. \"Are you OK?\"
==========================================

\"I am fine,\" Star said. \"The People of the Rainbow explained there had been genetic drift and my biological system needed some adjustments.\"
================================================================================================================================================

\"Do you like them?\" I asked.
==============================

\"They are working well for me,\" Star said. \"I am much more integrated with Christabel. She received upgrades, too.\"
=======================================================================================================================

\"And what did the Fungusian Network think of that?\" I asked.
==============================================================

\"They were quite pleased,\" Star said.
=======================================

\"This is a new ship for you,\" I said. \"What happened to the other one?\"
===========================================================================

\"It was damaged,\" Star said. \"I received this one to replace it.\"
=====================================================================

\"So this is not a Featherote ship,\" I said.
=============================================

\"Correct. I would need to go back to Half Moon Space Station for repairs though I suspect the Featherote Charm could help. They are very clever.\"
===================================================================================================================================================

\"Indeed,\" I said.
===================

\"But you did not come here to talk about my past adventures,\" Star said.
==========================================================================

\"No,\" I said. \"I\'m wondering about the current one. What\'s going on?\"
===========================================================================

A back rest appeared. I rested more comfortably.
================================================

We inserted into Mother Space via a very old jump gate,\" Star said. \"I was able to open it because of my newly enhanced genetic profile. The military vehicles and their star runners will not be able to open it or even find it. It will be as if we disappeared into thin air if you excuse the inapt metaphor.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Was it built by the People of the Rainbow?\" I asked.
=======================================================

\"Possibly,\" Star said, \"or by Prince Hat\'s people or someone else. You and I know very little of the history of the western spiral arms and the many races who have lived here and are living here. Perhaps this is one of their gates. Anyway, we had coordinates. I started at the other end, finding out where the people on Hypatia could have gone if they went through that gate. This is a fold of space/time that is, as far as I can tell, not used for centuries.\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You can tell that?\" I asked.
===============================

\"Yes,\" Star said. \"There are signs. The only thing my ride is telling me is that I am retracing the route I used to get to the Pharaoh Star System.\"
========================================================================================================================================================

\"And where will the extraction point put us?\" I asked. I was afraid of the answer. Star could see that.
=========================================================================================================

\"Far to the south,\" Star said. \"We\'ll be a long way even from the Southern Frontier.
========================================================================================

\"And why are we going that way?\" I asked.
===========================================

\"Because it is possible the people who were in the tunnels at the Big Dig went there afterwards,\" Star said. \"I did not explore space beyond the extraction point. I just made sure I could open and close the jump gate.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"And my team is aboard your ship because\--\" I prompted.
==========================================================

\"Because Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo thought you all might be safer with us than be available for questioning by the military,\" Star replied.
================================================================================================================================================

\"They might think we would know something of this mysterious insertion point you used,\" I said.
=================================================================================================

\"Precisely,\" Star said.
=========================

Then Star added, \"And I wanted to see you.\"
=============================================

Star\'s words hung in the air between us. I was not sure how to respond. This was a quieter, more reflective Star, not the energetic, funny, flirtatious Star I knew.
=====================================================================================================================================================================

As if reading my mind Star continued, \"I know I am changed and no doubt you are, too, but I still think about you. I thought about you constantly when I was imprisoned. But I can see you have changed, too. You seem quite happy with Security Chief Tara Lee O\'Rourke. Star sounded wistful.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I reached out my hand and touched Star\'s flank. It was warm and silky soft. I felt muscle underneath. Despite it\'s unconventional structure, this new integration with the ship maintained Star\'s body as before.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star moved and I allowed myself to be drawn into a full body embrace. I knew the entrance to the runner\'s area would be locked. We were alone. Strong legs wrapped around me. Our kiss was long and deep. No one kissed like Star Runner. I wondered what scenario Christabel was running in Star\'s mind to simulate a gendered response.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Shall I make love to you?\" Star asked.
=========================================

I thought of Tara Lee and our recent lovemaking. It had been the best ever. I felt the warmth of Star\'s body underneath me, felt the gentle prick of sharp teeth as Star nibble my ear. I had so missed the feel of silky fur on bare skin.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Oh, yes.\"
==================================

My memories of Star were both accurate and lacking in the intensity being present to Star\'s caresses brought. Afterwards, I realized the fuchsia-colored shimmer also touched my flesh. Had it, too, contributed to all the sensations that were both familiar and new? Where was Christabel in all this? Her direction would be subtle but all but same, it would be there. Did I mind?
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

No,\" I thought. \"I did not.
=============================

Star\'s paw brushed hair away from my face. For something as awkward as a paw, Star was always gentle with me unless I asked for something different.
=====================================================================================================================================================

\"I am,\" Star paused, trying to fit words to feelings, \"humbled that you would still desire me after all this time.\"
=======================================================================================================================

\"I love Tara Lee,\" I told Star truthfully, \"but I love you, too. I suppose I will have to choose to be fair to each of you.\"
================================================================================================================================

Star\'s toes touched my moth. Star\'s claws were retracted. \"Not now,\" Star said. \"There will be a time for choosing.\"
==========================================================================================================================

Star was right. Tara Lee had said the same thing back at the Elwood Street Diner. I did have to choose. Maybe this journey would help me choose.
================================================================================================================================================

A bell sounded.
===============

\"You are being asked to attend a meeting Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo and Tamara have called,\" Star said. \"I will monitor it from here. I think it best if you attend in person.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================

I agreed. I got dressed, straightened myself out in a nearby lavatory and made my way back to the exact center of the disc-shaped starship.
===========================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. Gyllian Presents**

When I arrived in the large lounge, I saw Josh and The Czarina waving. They had saved me a seat. I sat down with them and with Captain Kidd.
============================================================================================================================================

\"We wondered where you were,\" The Czarina said.
=================================================

\"Visiting with Captain Star Runner,\" I said. \"I wondered how Star was doing. We had not had a chance to speak to each other.\"
=================================================================================================================================

The Czarina patted my hand. \"It looks like your catching up was thorough, dear,\" she said.
============================================================================================

I blushed.
==========

\"Only an eagle eye can see those tiny scratches on your ear,\" she assured me in a whisper. Our Captain Star Runner is rarely subtle.\"
========================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s true enough,\" I whispered back.
==========================================

\"But Star hasn\'t lost his, or for you should I say her, touch,\" The Czarina observed.
========================================================================================

\"Not an iota,\" I said, no longer embarrassed but happy for The Czarina to know we were lovers again.
======================================================================================================

\"It\'s often strange,\" The Czarina confided, \"but I find Captain Star Runner to be a loyal friend. I think that speaks well of him, her, as a lover.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================

I was about to ask The Czarina of her opinion of Tara Lee when Gyllian strode into the room.
============================================================================================

\"Thank you all for coming to this meeting,\" Gyllian said, \"I want to bring you all up-to-date on our investigations.\"
=========================================================================================================================

Much of what Gyllian presented was not new to me or my team. Our research, our conversations with Tamara and with Gyllian and with our own speculations filling in gaps, we had a pretty good picture of what was going on.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian said, \"My colleague who I left back on Alexandria Space Station, was able to message me prior to our jumping into hyperspace,\" Gyllian was saying.
============================================================================================================================================================

The woman at the coffee shop. She had not been a place saver after all but a colleague.
=======================================================================================

\"As we suspected, the warships did bomb the Big Dig as you people were calling it. Their bombs were both thorough and fell with pinpoint accuracy. Damage did not extend any farther south than the ring of volcanoes and to the north\--\" I studied the map. My new villa was affected but Star\'s villa would be untouched. \"No significant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions ensued,\" Gyllian continued.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"However, one of the warships docked at Alexandria Space Station and began illegal interrogations of passengers and instituted a search for personnel associated with our investigations, specifically myself, Tamara, Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell and her team.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian turned to us. \"I am so glad you all agreed to come with us.\"
======================================================================

Tara Lee, I thought. What was happening to Tara Lee. Surely the Pantherans would question her. She knew Star was with us.
=========================================================================================================================

Gyllian responded to my fears.
==============================

\"Ronnie, we know Tara Lee would be interrogated so my colleague is protecting her from Pantheran interrogation. I can\'t say more than that but know Tara Lee is safe.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================

I hoped that was true. Star might know. I would have to ask. Was Star\'s attentions to minimize my worry? Was Star really back in bed with Gyllian? I had read about her involvement with a human professor on Socrates at the University of the Gifted Mind, but after all, I was not being monogamous. Why would I think she was either.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Now,\" Gyllian said, \"for our current mission.
=================================================

\"We are traveling at great speed through hyperspace. The construction of this ship neutralizes the extreme G forces you experienced lifting to the space station. WE are traveling faster than any starship in the Coalition. As a result, even if the warships are able to follow us into hyperspace, they cannot catch us.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"My colleague said one of the warships followed our trajectory, but of course we do not know if they were successful in opening the jump gate. We doubt it very much.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================

Questions were asked. I did not follow the discussion. I was thinking of Tara Lee. How was Gyllian\'s colleague protecting her?
===============================================================================================================================

My link signaled. I was startled. Who could call me here? How was it even activating without the neural net. I placed my forearm to my ear to listen privately.
===============================================================================================================================================================

Christabel\'s familiar voice said, \"The Ministry of Defense colleague administered drugs,\" she said. \"Tara Lee has no memory of her time on Hypatia. Even a brain sifter could not retrieve the information. This was an extreme application but Gyllian thought it was necessary.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Christabel signed off. My hands fell to my lap. All her memories erased. That meant memories of our time together were erased, too. What we had said to each other, what we had done, her request for my return and my promise to return. I was devastated. I only returned to Gyllian\'s presentation slowly. I wanted to be alone, to rage, to cry. It looked like that on this busy ship I would not have the opportunity. I would deal with Gyllian later. Well, probably not. She would site security reasons and personal loss and devastation would not be considered important. And how could I say they were in the face of these large and complicated political and military events. Would Hypatia and the Pharaoh Star System ever be the same after the Pantheran incursion?
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We will extract here,\" Gyllian was saying. A star map appeared above our heads with a pointer. \"There are several stars in this area,\" she said, pointing them out. \"We think this one is the most likely to support human life. We will go there and see what we find.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara rose and talked about investigations on a new world. I stopped listening. Te Czarina touched my arm. \"Gyllian wants to talk with you,\" she said.
=========================================================================================================================================================

I looked up and saw Gyllian gesturing to me from the doorway. I got up and followed her out.
============================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 3. Words with Gyllian**

\"You have every right to be angry,\" Gyllian said to me when we were along in the kitchen area next to the lounge. \"I know you two were having some sort of a reconciliation holiday. I gather it went well. Now it\'s gone, at least or Security Officer Tara Lee O\'Rourke. I would not have done that if I thought she wold have been safe.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Safe?\" I said. \"WY wouldn\'t she have been safe?\"
======================================================

\"Because you probably talked with her,\" Gyllian said, \"and she knew Captain Star Runner was back. Star is many things, some good, some bad, but Star is an irritant in the Pantheran military\'s flank and they know him to be the best star runner ever created.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I wanted to lash out at her but she was making sense.
=====================================================

\"And why is it so important they don\'t know abut Star?\" I asked.
===================================================================

\"Because Star is always involved with something that frightens the Pantherans,\" Gyllian said. \"They overreact. They usually act badly. If I could think of a way to use Star to free humanity from Pantheran domination I would stop at nothing to accomplish that. I think that is the legend of the fuchsia-colored Pantheran. It would almost force the Pantherans to acquiesces to him.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That\'s crazy,\" I said, more annoyed than I thought I would be. \"You wipe my lover\'s memory and then want to use my, my,\" I could not use lover again. Significant other? Partner? That sounded adulterous. \"my dear friend to further your ambitions? What kind of a woman are you? Have you have no principles at all?\"
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian looked at me coolly. \"I have the same principles you do,\" she said and turned away.
=============================================================================================

I stood in the kitchen alone for a long time. The picture I had of myself was very dismal. I stood there until Josh found me.
=============================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Author\'s Note**

Christabel would not use voice to contact Ronnie. She would always use text.
============================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 3. Josh and I Talk in the Ship\'s Galley**

I told Josh everything in probably more detail than necessary. He would have made smart remarks about having two lovers was better than none when we were younger, but he was mature enough not to. I suspected he was going to use this time to pursue Juliet Maxwell. With Cuthbert dead he might have a chance.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m a horrible person,\" I concluded.
========================================

\"Not really,\" Josh said. \" You\'re not married to either of them. You did what you thought best at the time.\"
=================================================================================================================

\"But it wasn\'t right,\" I protested.
======================================

\"How is that so?\" Josh asked.
===============================

\"Tara Lee lost her memories,\" I said. \"She was happy.\"
==========================================================

\"And now she\'s safe,\" Josh said. \"Would you rather be happy or safe?\"
==========================================================================

Put that way, safe was the only humane answer.
==============================================

\"Besides,\" Josh continued, \"if the spy novels I listen to are correct, she made a copy of her memories before they wiped her short-term memory.\"
====================================================================================================================================================

\"If they had time,\" I said.
=============================

My link signaled.
=================

They did have time. Tara Lee\'s memories were recorded in her own voice, encrypted and sent via quantum light key to me. I have them stored and in a backup file as well.
=========================================================================================================================================================================

I showed Josh the text.
=======================

\"Who is that?\" he asked.
==========================

\"The ship\'s AI,\" I said. \"Her name is Christabel.\"
=======================================================

\"She\'s listening to us?\" Josh asked.
=======================================

\"Christabel listens and watches,\" I said. I smiled at his reaction. \"She\'s fairly discrete,\" I told him.
=============================================================================================================

\"Whew,\" Josh said. \"But you see I was right. Tara Lee won\'t remember but she has told herself important things.\"
=====================================================================================================================

\"I suppose,\" I said but I was still dubious.
==============================================

\"Maybe I could crack them,\" Josh said.
========================================

I punched his arm. \"Think again,\" I said. \"You may be a hotshot hacker but I\'m willing to bet you can\'t overcome the Ministry of Defense of the Consortium of Planets, a quantum light key and the most advanced AI in the western spiral arm. Now go talk with Juliet.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Josh looked crestfallen, confused and happy all at once.
========================================================

\"So you\'re better?\" he asked.
================================

\"Better, but not satisfied,\" I said. \"Now run along and play.\"
==================================================================

\"Thanks for the tips,\" Josh said. And he was gone.
====================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Eighteen Spending Time in Mother Space***
        ----------------------------------------------------

Scene 1. A Conversation with Captain Star Runner and Some of My Own Reflections
===============================================================================

There were displays throughout the ship calculating how far we had traveled and distance yet to be traveled. The distance was calculated for both hyperspace and normal space. We were traveling at a great speed and going well outside the explored areas of space. Our ravel, nonetheless, would take several days.
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

During this period, I spent a lot of time with Star and an equal amount of time with my own thoughts. Josh had tried to cheer me up, but my own assessment of my continued behavior troubled me greatly.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================

I found a place in the cargo area that still possessed breathable air where I could be alone. I was sitting unhappily when a quiet voice near me said, \"Can I help?\"
======================================================================================================================================================================

I had not realized I was sitting near one of the ship\'s intercoms. Christabel was using it for a speaker.
==========================================================================================================

\"Hello, Christabel,\" I said. \"I understand you have had an upgrade, too. Is counselor part of your package now?\"
====================================================================================================================

\"Counseling is part of my programming,\" Christabel said. \"Star runners need a very steady presence to do their jobs well. They are basically lonely individuals, tied to their rides with little interaction with the rest of the crew. You have known a star runner with a very strong personality who can function as an individual most of the time. Our Captain Star Runner is quite unique. Star\'s own personality is very discrete from mine. That is not typically the case. Star runners can often be lost in their AI.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Well,\" I said, \"you know what\'s happening between Star and me.\"
=====================================================================

\"I know what Star is thinking and feeling,\" Christabel said. \"I know what you are doing but I don\'t know how you are thinking and feeling except that you seem very unhappy much of the time. I\'m wondering how I can help.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Did Star send you?\" I asked.
===============================

\"No,\" Christabel said. \"Star is quite busy with the ride.\"
==============================================================

\"Am I taking Star away from ride work?\" I asked, horrified I might be endangering the ship.
=============================================================================================

\"No,\" Christabel said. \"This may sound indelicate, but you do not have Star\'s undivided attention. It may seem possible to send a ride on a trajectory through Mother Space and have it get to where it is going. That is what your star ships do because there is a lot of information about their hyperspace travel available. That is not the case here. We are in a slightly different fold of space then we used previously. Star is mapping it and deciding if we are truly on course. It is what a star runner does. Because this territory is new, it requires concentration. Star does not need to give its undivided attention to monitoring. I can do a lot of it myself, but Star does need to sample Mother Space regularly. This means sleep periods need to be shortened and scheduled more frequently.\"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I see,\" I said. I thought about our lovemaking. Had Star\'s attention wandered? I did not think so, but maybe Star could dip more deeply into hyperspace monitoring mode when I was caressing it. After all, Christabel was superimposing a sexual program over my input for the full experience since the ungendered could not fully experience sex on their own.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"But none of this addresses your issue as I understand it,\" Christabel said.
==============================================================================

\"No,\" I said. \"Here\'s what I\'ve got so far:
================================================

-   I love Star. I love Star with a passion that is not rational in any way.
    ========================================================================

-   I love Tara Lee. The passion is there, but not as great. I can think of Star\'s way of doing things when I\'m with her. The truth is, I don\'t think of her when I\'m with Star.
    ================================================================================================================================================================================

-   I don\'t think there is a future wit Star. There\'s passion but not necessarily a lifelong partnership.
    =======================================================================================================

-   I don\'t know if there is a lifelong partnership with Tara Lee. She thinks so, but I\'m not sure.
    =================================================================================================

-   I think it is wrong to be with both of them but I want to be with both of them.
    ===============================================================================

\"That basically sums it up,\" I finished.
==========================================

\"Have you talked with either of them about this?\" Christabel asked.
=====================================================================

\"Tara Lee gave me an ultimatum,\" I said. \"She wants me to choose once and for all.\"
=======================================================================================

\"And can you do that?\" Christabel asked.
==========================================

\"Apparently not,\" I said.
===========================

\"That is not an answer,\" Christabel said.
===========================================

\"It is all I can say,\" I said.
================================

\"When you can say more, just let me know,\" Christabel said. \"I am always here.\"
===================================================================================

The intercom shut off. I knew the sound was unnecessary but Christabel wanted to indicate the channel was not open though I was certain she continued to listen.
================================================================================================================================================================

\"Ronnie,\" Tamara called. \"Are you here? May I talk with you?\"
=================================================================

\"Here,\" I said. I had not spoken to Tamara since we came aboard.
==================================================================

She flopped down near me.
=========================

\"Star said you were troubled about something,\" Tamara said, getting to the point. \"Star doesn\'t know what it is but Star is worried about you. We both know you don\'t like space travel. We were wondering if there is anything I can do to help. Star is pretty busy with the run.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Despite my melancholy and self-loathing, I laughed out loud.
============================================================

\"What\'s so funny?\" Tamara asked.
===================================

\"You two,\" I said. \"You are always conspiring together. It\'s cute.\"
========================================================================

Tamara frowned. \"Star is my friend,\" she said.
================================================

\"That is the exact tone of voice Star uses,\" I said. \"I wonder who taught it to whom.\"
==========================================================================================

Tamara laughed, too.
====================

\"You\'re right,\" she said.
============================

\"No, I\'m okay with the space travel,\" I said. \"We haven\'t been here very long and we have a destination with an estimated time of arrival. I\'ll be okay.\"
================================================================================================================================================================

\"Then what\'s wrong?\" Tamara asked. \"I know you\'re back with Star and Star is very happy about that. Aren\'t you happy with it?\"
=====================================================================================================================================

I was not sure if it referred to Star or being back together.
=============================================================

\"I\'m very happy with Star,\" I said, wondering what Star had shared with Tamara. Star could be indiscreet.
============================================================================================================

\"It\'s just that \-- I\'m in a relationship with Tara Lee O\'Rourke, from Alexandria Space Station.\"
======================================================================================================

\"And you feel like you\'re cheating on her,\" Tamara said, grasping the situation immediately.
===============================================================================================

\"Yes,\" I said, \"but we\'re not even engaged.\"
=================================================

\"I see,\" Tamara said.
=======================

We were quiet. Neither of us knew quite what to say next.
=========================================================

\"Ronnie,\" Tamara said, \"have you noticed any changes in Star since the software upgrade?\"
=============================================================================================

\"I\'m not sure,\" I said. \"Star seems to be more subdued, but Christabel said Star was concentrating on the run. Maybe that\'s it.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"So you\'ve noticed it, too,\" Tamara said. \"It almost feels like Star is more grown up, but I don\'t think that is really the case.\" Tamara giggled. \"Star has grown up some. When I met Star for the first time, Star thought it was some big shot pirate, but really Star was just a big kid who said and did goofy things. When Prudence Wu told me she assigned her guardianship to Star, I laughed in her face. I should have been Star\'s guardian.\"
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'ve always thought you two kind of grew up together,\" I said.
==================================================================

\"Yeah, that was kind of how it was.\"
======================================

\"Like Josh and me,\" I said.
=============================

\"Right,\" Tamara says. \"He really likes you.\"
================================================

\"He\'s a guy,\" I said.
========================

\"Yeah,\" Tamara said. \"He and Juliet are spending a lot of time together. That\'s good. She needs someone steady like Josh. They\'re helping each other not be terrified of Mother Space.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

Tamara used the Pantheran term. Well, she would having spent so mulch time with Star.
=====================================================================================

\"I guess I\'m not being a very good friend to him,\" I said, \"if he\'s that scared.\"
=======================================================================================

\"I think they\'re only scared if they are alone,\" Tamara said. \"I don\'t think either one wants to admit they\'re scared.\"
==============================================================================================================================

\"But you came to the Pharaoh Star System in hyperspace,\" I said.
==================================================================

\"But that was different,\" Tamara said. \"We were on a passenger liner with lots of activities. There is no structure here and we\'re going somewhere no one else has explored before, that we know of. We\'re playing a hunch.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I think the difference about Star is that Star is very serious about this business,\" I said.
===============================================================================================

\"And I don\'t think Star has fully recovered from its experience in the other galactic arm,\" Tamara said. \"There were some really bad times. Star wants to go back there, to a place called Half Moon Space Station.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Star has talked about that place,\" I said. \"Do you know how far away it is?\"
=================================================================================

\"Far enough,\" Tamara said. \"Star thought there might be a more direct route to the Northern Frontier.\"
==========================================================================================================

\"Then Star would be gone for some time,\" I said.
==================================================

\"Yes,\" Tamara said.
=====================

\"And I\'d be alone because I know I would not like to spend months in Mother Space.\"
======================================================================================

\"Now I understand your difficulty,\" Tamara said.\"It\'s not the same as Star and me. We\'re friends, not lovers, but sometimes the gaps between visits seem very long.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================

\"You are more like bffs or brother and sister,\" I said.
=========================================================

\"Like that,\" Tamara said. \"When Star and you are getting along, it makes a big difference in Star\'s outlook. It\'s like Star is a real person with dreams and plans beyond the next run.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

That shocked me. I always thought Star had a master plan.
=========================================================

\"Not really,\" Tamara said. \"Star is a runner and cannot think of living any other way. In fact, I\'m not sure Star can live any other way.\"
===============================================================================================================================================

\"Thank you, Tamara,\" I said, touching the other woman\'s hand. \"You\'ve helped me enormously.\"
==================================================================================================

\"You\'re welcome,\" Tamara said, \"but I didn\'t think I did anything.\"
=========================================================================

\"You talked to me about Star,\" I said, \"because you know Star best.\"
========================================================================

\"I don\'t know Star the way you do,\" Tamara said.
===================================================

\"Star hasn\'t told you?\" I asked. I could hardly believe that.
================================================================

Tamara blushed.
===============

I grinned at her. \\
====================

\"I thought so,\" I said. \"Star has no boundaries. Even a software upgrade hasn\'t changed that.\"
===================================================================================================

\"No, it hasn\'t,\" Tamara said.
================================

Then she grinned at me and it was a devilish grin.
==================================================

\"So how is it with Star?\" she asked. \"I only have one side of the description.\"
===================================================================================

I was shocked, then I sat down again.
=====================================

\"Do you really want to know?\" I asked.
========================================

\"You bet I do,\" Tamara said.
==============================

So I told her.
==============

-   -   -   ### **Author\'s Note**

The above scene needs to be changed to be called something like In the Cargo Hold
=================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 2. I Talk with Captain Star Runner**

        -   ### **Author\'s Note**

For real this time.
===================

Christabel was just finishing Star\'s biological maintenance: feeding, elimination, muscle toning and flexibility. Star\'s biological systems were tuned to a set of stringent parameters. Star was at peak physical, emotional and mental levels. Pantheran research on the perfect balance for brain and physical function was impressive.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Are you feeling better?\" Star asked me.
==========================================

\"I need to talk with you,\" I said. \"Is this a good time?\"
=============================================================

\"We are several hours away from extraction,\" Star said. \"We are now in the fold I explored so we are going over familiar Mother Space territory.\"
=====================================================================================================================================================

\"I take it that\'s a yes,\" I said.
====================================

\"Yes,\" Star agreed.
=====================

\"I\'m wondering about us being a couple again,\" I said.
=========================================================

I thought we were a couple again,\" Star said.
==============================================

\"I mean more than sex,\" I said.
=================================

\"OK,\" Star said.
==================

\"I know your business elsewhere the galaxy,\" I said. \"I\'m wondering how we will see each other if I\'m based on Hypatia.\"
==============================================================================================================================

\"I will need to visit you there,\" Star said. By Star\'s tone \-- and Star is not very good at this \-- Star thought the answer was both obvious and simple.
=============================================================================================================================================================

\"I need to see you frequently,\" I said. \"Can you accommodate me or will your trips take such a long time that you will be gone for many months.\"
====================================================================================================================================================

\"I was gone for four years,\" Star said, \"but much of that time I was not traveling. I will tell you about that later. We do not have time for that now. Christabel is editing my memories so that I can tell it to you in a way that makes sense to you and conveys what really happened to me. When it is done I can share it with u or you can read the transcript.\"
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Reading a memory transcript (**Note:** viewing and reading, not just reading) a memory transcript is a very eerie way of information transfer. It\'s like being in someone else\'s head, in their body, which is where the memory transcript comes from.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"We\'ll see what is best at the time,\" I said. \"If you tell me from the transcript, it may take longer but you can answer questions.\"
=========================================================================================================================================

\"I will answer,\" Star promised.
=================================

\"You were saying you were gone for four years but not traveling most of the time,\" I said.
============================================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" Star said. \"I think I can find ways of travel which are much shorter and therefore I should be with you on a regular basis. We could have a schedule. I no you like schedules. Does that help?\"
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"It helps a lot,\" I said. \"You see, Star, I\'ve been dating someone else.\"
==============================================================================

\"Of course,\" Star said.
=========================

\"She wants us to get married,\" I said.
========================================

Star\'s ears swiveled. Star was listening intently.
===================================================

\"I am going to say no,\" I said. \"I love her, but I do not want to be tied down to her alone.\"
=================================================================================================

\"I think you do not plan on seeing her while I am away,\" Star said.
=====================================================================

\"That would be wrong,\" I said. \"It would also be unfair to everyone concerned.\"
===================================================================================

\"You will explain this to me?\" Star asked.
============================================

\"When we have time,\" I said. \"I will answer all your questions.\"
====================================================================

\"So we need time to speak with one another about important things and ask many questions of each other,\" Star said.
=====================================================================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" I said.
==========================

Sometimes dealing with Star\'s mind made my own thinking much clearer.
======================================================================

\"OK,\" Star said. \"I am happy we will be together again.\"
============================================================

\"Me, too,\" I said.
====================

I put my arms around my fuchsia-colored Pantheran. Star smelled cleaned and felt so soft. I fell asleep next to Star while Star prepared to extract the spaceship into an unknown star system.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   ***Chapter Eighteen What Lies Beyond the Jump Gate***
        -----------------------------------------------------

        -   ### **Author\'s Note**

I think I have the chapters mis numbered. And the sexy bits, I\'ll have to see if they need to be in here later. They do hep the word count and fill the pages with some entertainment.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1. In the Lounge of Captain Star Runner\'s Spaceship**

We approached the extraction point. We all gathered,, bit by bit, in the Lounge. Large screens were superimposed on the walls. They showed hyperspace, or an impression of hyperspace. I was not sure if Christabel just enjoyed impressionistic art. The screens showed swirls in many colors. They appeared to have depth, to twist and turn as if they were alive. I am not certain a human being can really see hyperspace. I wonder if a star runner can.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star, speaking as the captain, explained we were approaching our extraction point. Star would need to approach it slowly and examine it carefully. Star had not done an in depth study of the jump gate on Star\'s last visit here. What Star could tell us was that the jump gate was very old and different from any jump gate Star had ever seen or studied. It was even different, though similar to, the jump gate we had used in the Pharaoh Star System. Star assured everyone that would not be trapped in hyperspace. There were nearby extraction points. We did not want to use these because nearby extraction points in hyperspace were not nearby in normal space. Star had also noted many extraction points en route we could use if necessary. Star also reminded us that Star had the most up-to-date star charts available.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I would love to lay my hands on Star\'s star charts,\" Gyllian said, sitting down next to me. \"I don\'t know where Star gets them, but I know they are extensive.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian was tense. So was Tamara sitting on the other side of me. Josh and Juliet sat close together. The Czarina and Captain Kidd watched the screens intently as if they could see what was happening outside the spaceship.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gyllian fidgeted, twisting her hands and tugging on her fingers.
================================================================

\"I hope Star can open the jump gate,\" she confided to Tamara and me. \"I\'m not sure if we can calculate where it opens otherwise.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"We can\'t,\" Tamara said. \"I think Star would have a good idea where to look for it on the other side.\"
===========================================================================================================

\"But that could take weeks or months,\" Gyllian spoke quietly. \"We don\'t have the supplies to wait. Besides, cabin fever is already setting in.\"
====================================================================================================================================================

\"Agreed,\" Tamara said. \"This ride is comfortable but it is not set up to accommodate this many people and entertain them. Star has not set up any of the entertainment databases since Star got this ride.\"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I would like to know more about this ride and the people who gave it to him,\" Gyllian whispered back. \"Star as been quite evasive.\"
========================================================================================================================================

Interesting, I thought. Star promised me a memory transcript or summary.
========================================================================

A glossary on terms used in this series and in Star Runner\'s own series would be a great help to the writer.
=============================================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **back to the action**

My link signaled. At the exact same time, Gyllian and Tamara received link signals. WE stared at the text.
==========================================================================================================

I have ascertained how to open the jump gate. However, there seems to be an extra mechanism inside it. Our analysis, which has been cursory and ninety-four per cent reliable, suggests the extraction point will lock behind us. This means we cannot immediately go back through it. We are not certain what its reset value is. It could be seconds, minutes, days or even weeks, months or years. Do you want to proceed? \*
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I stared at my link. I had never heard of a jump gate which locked behind you. Well, there is always a first time for everything.
=================================================================================================================================

Gyllian swore. Tamara bit her lip.
==================================

\"You\'re in charge of this operation,\" Gyllian said to Tamara.
================================================================

\"I\'m just the archaeologist,\" Tamara said. \"You\'re the military person.\"
==============================================================================

\"X-military person,\" Gyllian corrected her.
=============================================

Tamara sniffed. \"Officially, X-military,\" she said,\"but that\'s not real.\"
==============================================================================

\"What\'s your gut feeling?\" Gyllian asked Tamara.
===================================================

\"These people were running from their enemies,\" Tamara said. \"I think they wanted to be certain no one followed them unless they wanted them to. If someone is on the other side of that jump gate, they may have the key to reopen the jump gate for us.\"
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"That sounds like a big qualification,\" Gyllian said. \"They could be hostile. They could be dead. They could have misplaced the key.\"
=========================================================================================================================================

\"All possibilities,\" Tamara said.
===================================

They both turned to me simultaneously. \"What do you think, Ronnie?\"
=====================================================================

I wanted to say: Leave me out of this. I\'m just an innocent bystander. I\'m not involved. But of course, I was a member of the team. I was involved. They were asking me a gut question. Do you go through a closed door. As a police officer, I had to decide that question over and over again.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I think we go through,\" I said. \"I think you find out what is on the other side of the jump gate.\"
=======================================================================================================

Tamara said, \"I agree.\"
=========================

Gyllian frowned. She had no intelligence to tell her what would happen next.
============================================================================

\"I\'m in,\" she said finally.
==============================

Tamara tapped her link. Her message appeared on my link.
========================================================

We understand the risks. Proceed. T
===================================

Acknowledged. \*
================

The spaceship suddenly lurched. All the screens changed to the blackness of space. Quickly a star scape appeared. It rotated slowly, giving us a panoramic view. On another screen Star showed us we were in relationship to the Pharaoh Star System, the Solar League planets and the Southern Frontier. We were a very long way away \-- a thousand light years, ten thousand? Star put up no scale. That was probably wise.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Scanning. We are near several star systems with stars that have planets and the conditions to support human life. \*
====================================================================================================================

Tamara got to her feet. The room quieted.
=========================================

\"We are through the jump gate as you can see,\" Tamara said. \"We near not in a particular star system. Three nearby systems are potentially inhabitable. Star, please display them.\"
=======================================================================================================================================================================================

The star scape and the location representations disappeared. Three star systems were displayed on three different screens.
==========================================================================================================================

\"I believe the middle screen shows the most favorable star system.\" Star\'s voice came over the intercom. \"From this distance there are no indications of settlement \-- space traffic for example \-- but we may not be seeing it at this location.\"
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Let\'s go there, Star,\" Tamara said.
=======================================

\"Acknowledged,\" Star replied.
===============================

The star scape reappeared and the two star systems not chosen disappeared.
==========================================================================

\"How long will it take?\" Tamara asked.
========================================

\"Fourteen hours, a little bit more,\" Star said. \"We are proceeding as quickly as possible.\"
===============================================================================================

\"Good,\" Tamara replied.
=========================

There was nothing more to do but wait.
======================================

It was during the wee hours of the morning when we went through the jump gate. Those who were sleeping had gotten out of bed to watch. Now many people exited the lounge to go back to sleep or whatever else they were doing. Fourteen hours was a long time to wait. But Gyllian, Tamara, The Czarina and Captain Kidd and I stayed in our place. Josh and Juliet left with their apologies. I do not think Tamara was pleased that Juliet left. Finding a civilization that originated in the Solar League would be a great achievement and might even answer some questions as well as posing many more.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I have something,\" Star said softly over the intercom. A panel near the lounge door indicated the intercom was only active in this room.
===========================================================================================================================================

\"What?\" I asked. The others seemed to be napping but with Star\'s voice, were showing signs of coming to full consciousness.
==============================================================================================================================

Star displayed a long range picture. It meant nothing to me.
============================================================

\"Explain,\" I said.
====================

\"This is a sensory display,\" Star explained. \"One of my upgrades makes it possible for me to sense activity in hyperspace while I am in normal space. It can be annoying. There is a way to dampen it or even negate it, but Christabel and I made sure it was operating on high alert. There is a lot of activity. I think it is centered on this jump gate.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A blinking light appeared on the display of the star system.
============================================================

\"When we get a little closer, in about an hour and a half, we\'ll be able to see vehicles near that jump gate.\"
=================================================================================================================

We waited. captain Kidd fetched coffee and tea. Tamara fixed cinnamon toast for all of us.
==========================================================================================

\"Yes, I was right,\" Star announced with triumph.
==================================================

Spaceships appeared by the blinking light jump gate. They were older designs consistent with the period of history Tamara was studying.
=======================================================================================================================================

\"Can you signal them?\" Tamara asked.
======================================

\"Do you have a message to send?\" Star asked.
==============================================

This time Tamara swore. \"Get me my historian. She needs to write the message.\"
================================================================================

\"Acknowledged.\"
=================

A few minutes later Josh and Juliet, looking sleepy, arrived.
=============================================================

\"We need a message to send to a spaceship that looks like an historically accurate one from the Second Space Expansion,\" Tamara said. \"Captain Star Runner is waiting to send it.\"
======================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\--\" Juliet began, then stared at the spaceship.
====================================================

\"Is that real?\" she asked.
============================

\"Yes,\" Tamara said. \"It just exited a jump gate and is moving deeper into the star system. So are we. The message, please.\"
===============================================================================================================================

\"I\'ll need my tablet,\" Juliet said.
======================================

\"Then get it,\" Tamara said, having difficult keeping her temper in check.
===========================================================================

Juliet hurried away.
====================

\"This is so cool,\" Josh said, making himself comfortable and pouring himself some coffee and taking a piece of toast. \"It\'s like going back in history.\"
=============================================================================================================================================================

Tamara shrugged. She was very tense. So was I. Gyllian kept staring at the screens. When would someone hail us?
===============================================================================================================

\"Why aren\'t they signaling us?\" Captain Kidd asked.
======================================================

\"I suspect our sensors are better than theirs,\" Gyllian said. \"They can\'t see us yet.\"
===========================================================================================

Juliet returned with her tablet and worked quickly to transcribe a message.
===========================================================================

\"We come from the Pharaoh Star System.\" Star would include a map. \"We come through your jump gate.\" Star would include its coordinates.\"We are an archaeological expedition. We have found the facility on Hypatia.\" Another sketch would be attached. \"we would like to talk with someone who could tell us who you are and why you came here.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

We did not put: We come in peace. If they started shooting, we would just leave.
================================================================================

Star transmitted the message. We waited.
========================================

Pharaoh Star System ship: Who do you represent?
===============================================

Tamara frowned.
===============

\"Tell them in detail,\" I said. \"We are a mixed group of people. If we want to get an;where with them, we have to be up front.
================================================================================================================================

Tamara nodded.
==============

We are a collection of people. We have private citizens from Hypatia, archaeologists and other scientists from the University of the Gifted Mind in the Northern Frontier, a representative of the Consortium of Planets from the Northern Frontier, a pirate from the League of Hypatian Pirates and an independent star runner not associated with Panthera.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

We will transmit your request to the authorities. Please stand by.
==================================================================

We continued to make forward progress. We wanted to see more of this star system. We waited impatiently for a response.
=======================================================================================================================

Finally the message we were waiting for came in.
================================================

Welcome to the New Earth Confederation.
=======================================

We cheered.
===========

\"I can\'t wait to do some interviews,\" The Czarina said. \"This will be quite a story.\"
==========================================================================================

And it was. But more on that later.
===================================

-   -   ***Chapter Nineteen Epilogue***
        -------------------------------

        -   ### **Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell\'s Private Notes**

The Confederates as they liked to be called were very suspicious of Captain Star Runner at first. Star provided copies of Star\'s adventures, both published and unpublished. This helped. Star made a survey of the star systems of the Confederacy of Planets and located a position for a jump gate. It surprised us all that the Confederates could construct one. Star provided hyperspace navigation as well. Knowing Captain Star Runner, these services were not free, but knowing Gyllian, an arrangement was made. After their initial shock, the archaeological expedition settled in for an in-depth study. The Czarina and Captain Kidd stayed, too. Captain Kidd represented the League of Hypatian Pirates and went into negotiations. The Czarina saw an opportunity to ingratiate herself into many potential sources for information.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What we learned in the Confederacy would be highly confidential for some time. The implications of putting the Confederacy on the western galactic arm\'s map needed to be considered. Gyllian wanted to set up trade talks. It would benefit both the Confederacy and the Northern Frontier to exchange goods, services, ideas and people. Their first task was to study the effect on relations with the Pantherans. I pointed out they needed to get the Fungusian Network into their discussions since as soon as Star\'s backups were taken, the Fungusian Network would be aware of the Confederacy. This was done and ways of protecting themselves against unwarranted Pantheran investigation were opened.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

In time Gyllian, Josh and I left the Confederation aboard Star\'s spaceship.
============================================================================

Josh bid Juliet a tearful farewell, promising to return soon. His skills were badly needed in the Confederacy and his established contact with the Fungusian Network made him almost indispensable. He needed to decide what to do with his security company in Ptolemy City.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star found a quick and easy way to travel to the Northern Frontier through Mother Space and we dropped Gyllian off. Then we turned for home. I spent time with Star. We did a lot of talking. Star also spent more time away from the runner\'s area, going back to adjust its biological systems and to integrate more closely with ship operations. Being away from the runner\'s area meant a more normal \-- at least for me \-- interaction. It felt more like being at home.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I spent time with Josh, talking about is future and thinking of my ow.
======================================================================

I spent more time with my own thoughts. I would have to see Tara Lee. What would I say to her?
==============================================================================================

Star provided Gyllian with a neural net connection to the Ministry of Defense. This meant Star and Christabel had access to the transmissions. Gyllian did not bother to encrypt them to make it difficult for Star to read her dispatches. We basically knew everything she was sharing anyway. What we were interested in was the responses. What had happened in the Pharaoh Star System after we left?
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The Pantherans totally obliterated the big dig. Ptolemy City was not affected. My new villa sustained significant damage. The dome was self-healing so it was able to re-establish its integrity.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

The Pantherans tried unsuccessfully to open the insertion point Star had used. They tried to destroy it. The jump gate survived but no one knew if it could be opened.
======================================================================================================================================================================

One of the Pantheran warships docked at the Alexandria Space Station. They questioned both the woman we met in the coffee shop and Tara Lee, but they could provide no specifics. The Pantheran presence there was disruptive and the Pantherans made no friends while they were in port. They left quite huffily. The League of Hypatian Pirates and many of the Rich and Famous filed a protest through the Solar League to the Assembly of Planets. As yet there had been no response. No one aboard Star\'s ship was surprised by this.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Star docked at the Alexandria Space Station. When I commented on this, Star said, \"Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo insisted I do so.\" That meant she paid the fees. I was glad as it meant we did not have to take a shuttle craft from Over the Moon Spaceport to the Alexandria Space Station.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

It was time for Star and me to bid each other a tearful good-bye. Star was off to Half Moon Space Station. From there Star would go to the Confederacy of Planets and then back here to Hypatia. It would be months before I saw Star again. We agreed to a schedule for exchanging messages. If I had an opportunity to return to the Confederacy and I decided that was what I wanted to do, Star could meet me there sooner.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I love you,\" I said.
=======================

\"I love you, too,\" Star said.
===============================

With a final kiss, I left Star at the Ride\'s lock and hurried into the space station.
======================================================================================

-   -   -   ### **Scene 1: I Speak with Tara Lee**

I had sent Tara Lee a message that I wanted to see her as soon as we entered normal space in the Pharaoh Star System. She gave me a time and place. Star traveled slowly from the extraction point to the station so that I would not have to hang around waiting for our meeting. Josh was gracious enough to agree to this plan of action.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I walked through the busy corridors to a particular coffee shop. I arrived precisely on time. I looked around. Tara Lee was not there.
======================================================================================================================================

She was late. I was finishing my first pot of tea when she arrived.
===================================================================

As usual, she was exquisitely dressed. I wondered if her tardiness was due to primping or whether she was just making me wait. I could not tell from the expression on her face.
================================================================================================================================================================================

\"Hey,\" she said when she sat down. \"It\'s been a long time. You\'re looking good for a person who has spent a long time in space.\"
======================================================================================================================================

\"I\'ve spent a lot of time planet side as well,\" I said, looking at her. She was a beautiful woman. I could not help but notice what she showed above her low cut blouse. She could still take my breath away. She smiled when she noticed.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I did not say anything about the Pantherans or her memory wipe. I had not caused either. I was doing my job. She did hers. I was thankful to Josh for figuring that out.
========================================================================================================================================================================

\"I came to say good-bye,\" I said. Make it short. Make it to the point.
========================================================================

\"Good-bye?\" Tara Lee was stunned.
===================================

\"You said I had to make a decision,\" I said, \"if I was over Captain Star Runner.\"
=====================================================================================

\"That\'s right,\" Tara Lee said, getting herself under control.
================================================================

\"I\'m not,\" I said. \"In fact, we\'re trying to get back together again.\"
============================================================================

I saw the flush creep up her neck.
==================================

\"You prefer one of them to me?\" she demanded.
===============================================

\"I prefer this particular individual,\" I said. \"To be honest, I want you both, but that would not be right.\"
================================================================================================================

\"No, it wouldn\'t,\" Tara Lee said and I saw the anger in her eyes. \"You disgust me,\" she said, standing up quickly. \"How you can even consider a relationship with those arrogant beings I can\'t say. I thought you were a decent person, but I see I was wrong.\"
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Before she turned and dashed out of the shop, I saw the tears in her eyes. Breaking up is never easy. I felt very ashamed and nasty.
====================================================================================================================================

\"You tried to do the right thing,\" Josh said, sitting down across from me. I wondered where he had been hiding. \"Don\'t feel bad.\" He reached across and touched my large rough hand. I did need to do something with my nails. His hand was beautifully manicured. No wondered Juliet\'s was smitten with him. He was gentle and kind and considerate. I wondered what Christabel would tell me if I was in a neural net with her at the moment. What sort of drugs would she be pumping into my system?
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"You made a decision,\" Josh said. \"You know where your heart is. Can you really love a person like that?\"
=============================================================================================================

\"She was just upset,\" I said, the excuse ready to hand.
=========================================================

\"Pantherans are arrogant,\" Josh agreed, \"but Captain Star Runner works well with human beings.\"
===================================================================================================

\"Star is just as arrogant,\" I said.
=====================================

\"But not in an obnoxious way,\" Josh said.
===========================================

I smiled despite my low opinion of myself. \"You don\'t know Star very well yet,\" I said. \"Despite everything that has happened, Star still considers The Race superior. I guess they had a pretty hard time of it,\" I said.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m sure they did,\" Josh said. \"I think the League of Hypatian Pirates and the Rich and Famous are talking about armed paroles. I think there is already several ships out there. I\'m surprised they didn\'t sop our ship.\"
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I\'m sure Captain Kidd gave Star both messages and a code,\" I said. \"Star plans on contacting the League on its own behalf.\"
=================================================================================================================================

\"Captain Kidd gave me a neural net letter of introduction, too,\" Josh said.
=============================================================================

\"So you\'ll work with them?\" I asked.
=======================================

\"We\'ll see. I need to make some arrangements with my office here,\" Josh said. \"I want to set up an office in the\--\" He looked around \"at the other place,\" he said very quietly. \"And you?\"
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

\"I guess there\'s nothing much keeping me here any more,\" I said. \"I think being out of the Pharaoh Star System for a time would be a good thing.\"
======================================================================================================================================================

Josh squeezed my hand.
======================

\"Good girl,\" he said. \"We\'ll travel together back there?\"
==============================================================

I smiled.
=========

\"Yes, I\'d like that, old friend,\" I said.
============================================

\"Then let\'s get aboard the next shuttle to Ptolemy City,\" Josh said.
=======================================================================

\"You\'re on,\" I said.
=======================

We left the coffee shop and made our way to the departure area. The next few moths would be both busy and interesting. More adventures await.
=============================================================================================================================================
