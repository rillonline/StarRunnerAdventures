The Adventures of Star Runner, the Pantheran:

The Library of the Mind: A Ghost Story

by Merrill Louise Woolnough

Chapter One
Grounded

Accidents happen. I know this. However, this accident need not have happened. A tanker birthed at Over the Moon exploded, causing a vicious chain reaction. Lives were loss. My ship, Three Little Kittens, was one of the ships which exploded. It was a total loss. Fortunately for me, I was planet side when the so-called accident occurred. I was also fortunate because my mini ship computer was able to put up sufficient barriers so that my brain was not inundated with garbled information from my shipboard computer. Unfortunately for me, the artificial intelligence which controls my biological functions and my symbiotic relationship with it was severed. I loss a good portion of my memory and I could not defragment my brain and have my memories archived for several days. This put me at a considerable disadvantage.

Hello, I'm Star Runner, a fuchsia-colored Pantheran. This is the story of what happened when I was forced to live planet side until a new ship could be constructed for me.

I don't know how it happened--this has never been satisfactorily explained to me--but within hours of the tanker's explosion, I received word from the Fungusians that a base station to replace my ship's artificial intelligence would arrive on Hypatia. The Fungusians manage my data storage. I would get back most of my shipboard memory They had also arranged for the remnants of my shipboard AI would be sent to them. Perhaps they could scavenge some additional memory. As it turned out, and it is beyond the scope of this narrative, they were able to get just about everything back.

The Fungusians had also notified the Plumies I was in need of a new ship. Within days the Plumies contacted me with tentative plans for a new ship. I made modifications, of course, and they promised to make it a top priority at their shipyard. I had a long working relationship with the Plumies. Their work was excellent though expensive. By the time the plans came in, I had a sense of what insurance I had and with my own money, I would have an excellent sense.



this is all background to explain I was marooned on Hypatia. I'm a Star Runner. I'm called by what I do--pilot spaceships. Among my own race, all spaceships are outfitted for pilots who integrate with their spaceships. Among Terries, though, my need for integration is peculiar so I cannot pilot their ships. I, therefore, have my own ship and take on jobs to ferry cargo outside Coalition Space. Outside the Coalition, my cargos are most often of a questionable legal standing. Law enforcement on the frontier is spotty. I refuse searches and I have never had a cargo ceased. Since the interdiction and my termination status, I don't go into Coalition Space so properly speaking, I'm not a gunrunner anymore though I still consider myself a pirate. I am, after all, associated with the League of Hypatian Pirates. Their rules--yes, pirates have rules--do not allow me to be a member of their organization, but we have this understanding.

As their name implies, the Hypatian Pirates are based on Hypatia, a planet of the Pharaoh Star System. It is a cold planet with volcanic action and a poisonous atmosphere. Ptolemy City is domed and was, at one time, the home of the Hypatian Pirates. Nowadays, it is the playground of wealthy Terrans who found it useful to have an outpost outside of the Coalition and its oversight.

I was born on a space station. I lived my life on space stations and in spaceships. I found planetary living confusing, difficult and a bits scary. It helps that Ptolemy City is a domed environment. It does not help at all that the dome is clear. I prefer to stay well inside the dome where I cannot see out to the horizon. Give me walls and narrow passageways. I feel at home then. Sky is not my friend.

I was familiar with the high-end hotels of Ptolemy City and the high-end shopping district. I was less familiar with the rest of the city. Although I found accommodation at Shepheard's Hotel for the first couple days I quickly realized I would need to find more reasonable accommodations. I had a per diem rate until my ship arrived. I did not want to supplement this amount if I could help it. I was also without work until my ship arrived. I needed a plan for the next few months. Hissing and slashing my tail would not change this so I quickly abandoned the practice and set out to learn how to live in a city.

"You need to find an apartment," the Czarina said as we sat at a small table on the Terrace at Shepheard's Hotel one morning. "I don't need an apartment," I said. "I only need a room."

"Have you looked for one" The Czarina asked. She was holding some pink drink which she claimed was her breakfast. If it was her breakfast, it was some alcoholic beverage tinged with color. I had made it clear to the Czarina I was not buying her breakfast which disappointed her mightily. I was managing a very small amount of money for my own needs.

"Well," she said, "have you gone on the local board and looked. I'm sure there's something."

"No," I said. "I really have no idea how to do this. I would have asked Emily Dickinson, but you know he's had a little bit of trouble."

"A bit of trouble," The Czarina said. "I call being convicted of a crime more than a bit of trouble. How long does he have to be exiled  in the Fends?"

"Several months," I said.

Properly speaking, the Fends is a swampy area at the far end of the dome from where we were sitting. It's sanitation center for the dome. As there are islands in the water, shacks exist. Criminals are exiled to this area and they cannot leave their islands while they are serving their sentences. Originally, Ptolemy city had no law, but with the advent of tourists, and a class of people to serve the tourists, law enforcement has become inevitable. Emily Dickinson was convicted of some sort of fraud. I never did understand the particulars. I'm not convinced Emily Dickinson did either. Why he had turned to scamming was beyond me. He was an accomplished assassin and that is not illegal on Hypatia.

I accessed the list through my connection to the base station I kept in my hotel room. I had an imbedded nano computer at my collar bone. It looks like a beautiful sapphire  and is similar to  my cerulean eyes. 

Because of the space station accident, there were very few entries. I realized I should have checked this board earlier. I really didn't know how to do this. The Czarina made suggestions.

"You know, Captain Star Runner, you should have done this when the accident first happened," the Czarina was saying. "You won't have very many good choices. You'll have to settle for something horrible."

"It's only a room," I said. I just need a place to sleep safely and to put my base station."

I skimmed the short list.

"Where is the Library of the Mind" I asked the Czarina.

"It's in the old section," The Czarina said. She tapped her com. A map appeared. I looked at it. 

"Oh," I said, "in the old commercial section, near the old chandleries. I know where that is."

I sent a text and got a prompt response to come immediately.

I got up from the table.

"Good-bye, Czarina," I said. "I'm off to check out this possibility."

"Did I read it included being a night security guard" the Czarina asked.

"I can do that," I said. "All I have to do is growl and Terries will run away. They're scared of members of The Race, you know."

I trotted off through the airy lobby out onto the street. A Gazelle was waiting, the smallest Caravan car, and I squeezed myself in. It meant I would not have to share and deal with the uncomfortable looks many Terries gave me. They also complained about the smell. Of course, Terries smell, too, but they don't 
think they do.

I jumped out at the major intersection in that part of Ptolemy City. I am familiar with this area because it is the site of the original Hypatian Pirate stockade. Hence the name of one of the streets: Stockade Street. The other is Front  Street. I would have expected a Rear Street or Back Street. Instead, it is called River Street. This makes some sense as it flows along the Nile River which comes in and out of the dome on its way to the North Sea.

I walked down Front Street a ways. The streets were empty this early in the day cycle. This area was much busier as the morning progressed and certainly into the evening. 

I found the Library of the Mind, a warehouse on Front Street between Pirate Close and Thieves' Alley. What wonderful names, I thought. I will like living here.

The walls of Pirate's Close rubbed up against my shoulders. Delightful! The door I was looking for would be at the end.

And there it was. I knocked.

Chapter Two
I Got This From Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe)

Silk had told me to expect someone for the night security guard's job. I was sitting at the desk we had set up in the entry room to act as a receptionist's desk. There was some computer work I could do while I waited for he applicant.

I was startled when I heard the knock. As the door opened, I saw the nose and the whiskers first. Shorter than a human, of course, the face appeared. Then the ears. What A cat A rather large cat. A fuchsia-colored cat? No, a Pantheran, in the flesh, paws, whiskers, tail and all. But weren't Pantherans pastel colors And weren't Pantherans ban, or at least, discouraged, from occupying planets outside the Coalition the point of the Library of the Mind was to be a repository of information banned in the Coalition. Was this a spy?

"Hello," the Pantheran said. 

It had deep blue eyes and a sapphire at its throat. It was quite grand, tail up, as it advanced.

"My name is Captain Star Runner," it said.

"You're Tamara's friend," I said, startling us both.

"Yes," it said. "How do you know my friend, Tamara?"

"I was one of her roommates at the University on Socrates," I said. "I'm Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe)."

This was no ordinary Pantheran standing before me. It was an androgen, a genetically-engineered Pantheran, designed to pilot spaceships and one of the only androgens ever known to leave the protection of its race and head out to live life independently among Terrans.

"I'm here about the job," Captain Star Runner said. "My ship was destroyed in the accident at Over the Moon."

"Oh, yes," I said. "We of course heard about that. I'm sorry about your ship. I know Tamara said you depend on it for everything."

"Yes," the Pantheran said. "I have a base station so I can manage. In the meantime, I need a place to stay."

"I can show you the room," I said. "We do expect some work."

"Yes," Captain Star Runner said. "I can prowl about. I catch rodents, too, if that is required."

"Oh, that would certainly be a help," I said. "We are having problems in that area."

I led the Pantheran behind the receptionist's desk into a hallway which ended in a flight of stairs. It negotiated these slowly and carefully. I could see it was not used to stairs.

"We don't have a lift working at this time," I said. "It makes the boxes difficult."

"The anti-grav sleds don't work well in stairways," it said. "Do you have a shaft"

"We're working on one. I'm surprised this warehouse doesn't have one."

"It does," it said confidently. "It may simply be hidden. I will inquire."

Tamara had said this creature was cocky. I certainly found it to be so.

I showed it the room we wanted to use. It was below ground with a basement window, a lavatory and a cot. It looked the room over and said I would do. 

Silk had empowered me to say yes or no, so I told the Pantheran it could have the job if it wanted it. Captain Star Runner accepted promptly.

"A Pantheran" Stephen Silk and his wife Gail Jeffrey's was startled at dinner.

"I know of this one," I said. "It's a friend of Tamara's. You remember Tamara.'

"A friend" Silk said.

"Yes," I said. "In fact, Captain Star Runner was Tamara's guardian. It did a rather credible job of it. They've kept in touch. Its ship was destroyed in the space station accident. It also offered to hunt mice."

"I suppose that's a plus," Silk said.

"Is it dangerous" Gail asked. "The children--"

"It's perfectly harmless," I said. It will prowl at night and sleep during the day. "We probably won't even know it's here."

"Except for the smell," Silk said.

"It thinks we smell, too," I said. "Trust me, Captain Star Runner will be an asset. It thinks we probably have a lift somewhere. It's going to look."

"Where is it now" Silk asked.

"Getting its things. I'm leaving some food in its lair."

"It's lair" Gail asked.

"That's what it calls its living area. I've sent off a message to Tamara for any pointers. It'll take a day or two to get an answer. We should be fine."

Chapter Three
Up On The Roof

And so my time at the Library of the Mind began.

I supervised the installation of my  base station and the bio connectors connected to my basket. I did not need my acceleration web on the ground though I missed all of its connections with my AI. The bio feed would allow my body to be regulated and my memory backups to proceed. The base station AI managed my memory storage adequately. Sadly for me, not all of my memory storage was available. The Fungusians had made some choices here. I was sad to find that Tamara's memories were not in tact. I knew who she was, of course, but anything she might have said about her time at university was missing. I might need them to deal with this Zora person and her colleagues. They smelled skittish to me and I suspected they were none too happy about my becoming their night security guard.  . I didn't anticipate a library would need much security. I thought my time might be spent mostly mousing.  

The underground room I was given was chilly. The  one window was barred and dirty. I made a note to have it cleaned and I put in an order at a planet side chandlery I knew to send over some blankets. I chose something soft. Wool was scratchy. I preferred quilts. I did not specify the color or pattern. Such details confuse me. I do not see such things as the Terries do.

At dusk I stepped through the door at the end of the building where I had entered. In either direction Pirate's close was empty. I began making a circumference of the building to learn the passageways.

Although there are real streets in this part of Ptolemy City, most areas are reached through narrow passageways much like those on a space station. This makes this part of the city very comfortable for me. The buildings are high, reaching within forty feet or so of the dome itself. Being that close to the planet's vistas is not comfortable for me, but the intent of the builders is clear. Freight in the old days was not transported via the street system. It was brought to the roof and then moved about to several strategically placed hatches. To my knowledge, these hatches have been sealed and not used for some time. Ships would connect to the hatches and their cargos brought aboard. These were interplanetary ships. They only brought their cargos as far as Cleopatra, Hypatia's larger moon where they were unloaded at the original Over the Moon spaceport. As I have explained elsewhere, this spaceport was abandoned but its name retained for the cargo area of the Alexandria Space Station where I dock and where the Three Little Kittens was destroyed.

There were only windows on Front Street. I could pick mine out below grade. I made another note to have some sort of material put over the windows. The chandlery called this material curtains and added what I required to my order and promised it would coordinate with my quilt. Would I also like a floor covering called a rug. Why not. They made some other suggestions including additional light. I rejected this need. As a night security guard, I would be outside most of the time. 

I instructed the base station AI to make the lighted and dark windows a priority. I had failed to ask for an internal map of the building and asked Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) for such a document. I then would know where the other occupants of the building were likely to be during the evening hours and where they would not be.

"I'm called Christabel," my AI informed me.

"Christabel?" I asked. "I've always called my AI's Ship."

"But I'm not your ship," the AI responded politely.

"What sort of a name is Christabel?" I asked.

"It's a Terran name," Christabel explained.

"Why do you have a Terran name" I asked.

"Because the Fungusians thought it would be better for me to have a Terran name on a Terran world," Christabel said.

"And why Christabel?" I persisted.

"Christabel was a member of the women's suffragette movement on Terra some time ago," Christabel said. "I was named for Christabel Pankhurst."

"You can tell me about that at some other time," I said.

"Not necessary," Christabel said.

Behind the Library of the Mind Pirate's Close veered off to the left while Thieves' Alley went straight. They were joined by another alley the length of the Library of the Mind's rear wall. There were no windows on either building flanking the alley. 

Looking down both Pirate's Close and Thieves' Alley, I saw other passageways. It would be some time before there was another street for ground cars. The warehouses back here would have been cheaper to rent and probably used for more clandestine goods. The silence suggested they were empty. I smelled no Terries and there were no lights anywhere.

I returned inside the Library of the Mind. and began walking through its internal passageways searching for the lift. I could climb the stairs but I dislike descending stairs. The warehouse was quite high and there would be many steps to the basement. An anti-grav belt would allow me to reach the roof line out-of-doors, but at the moment, I was not certain I needed such a device. A suitable anti-grav belt for me is expensive. After my time planet side, I did not know how often I would use such a device.

The lift was not hard to find. I was surprised the Terries had not found it. Perhaps they enjoyed using the stairs.

Lifts are not elevators with many working parts. They are anti-grav units that allow an individual to either rise or fall in a controlled manner. I found the access panel and with Christabel's help, we ran numerous diagnostics. As old as the building was, I was gratified how well the unit checked out. I did, however, go back to the basement for my first use of its mechanism and requested to go only to ground level. That was successful. My descent to the basement was also successful. I then went from floor to floor, walking through all the passageways I could find before asking to be taken to the roof.

This proved to be more difficult than I anticipated. The hatch did not automatically open. I smacked my head on it. Fortunately, Christabel sent the biologically signals for my left forepaw to reach out and put the anti-grav on hold. That button was large and easy to find. It was one of the many times I was grateful to be connected so intimately to my AI. We began scanning for the controls for the hatch.

I would never have found. Fortunately, Christabel had programming to consider devices from the viewpoint of a wide variety of species. The controls were where a right-handed Terran would find them comfortable. When pressed, the hatch rose obediently and within a few moments I scrambled out onto the roof. The hatch dutifully closed behind me. Christabel noted where the release was located for my journey back down.

The view from the roof was breathtaking. Standing up there alone in the dark with the quietness of the commercial area of Ptolemy City all around me, it was as if I stood on the exterior of my ship gazing out into space. I could see the stars and Hypatia's smaller moon,Mark Antony. It was a mining colony. Great ore ships docked there. I could see one far off to my right, its running lights visible as it made its way toward what remained of Over the Moon. The region around Mark Antony was restricted space. No other freighters could dock there. he ore would be offloaded onto other ships that would make their way out of the Pharaoh Star System. In front of me one of Hypatia's many volcanoes spewed lava hundreds of miles in the air. It was at some considerable distance from Ptolemy City. It was bright blue tonight with red and green areas which changed as I watched. In the foreground I saw the sulphur snow, mostly red and orange tonight.

Ptolemy City rocks on its base because the landmass on which it is built moves on the ever-changing landscape of Hypatia. The physics of how the dome does not break apart are very complicated and I will not go into them here. Ptolemy City changes position relative to the first and second cataracts of the Nile River while the Nile River itself shifts its position relative to the Plain of Chariots. It continues to empty itself into its broad Delta and thence to the North Sea. 

An anti-grav belt, I decided, might be useful while standing up here on the roof. A particularly strong quake could throw me off the roof. There were no parapets.

I scanned the dome, delighting in the view of stars, searching for one of the big cargo hatches. I found it, way off to my left. I wanted to go have a look at it, but for the moment, I had no way to get up there. I needed a jet pack, to skim over the rooftops and up.

"Expensive," Christabel advised. "You do not have a revenue stream at the moment and the insurance claims are not settled from the accident."

"Agreed," I said.

"Besides, you are not proficient in the use of such devices."

"But I can become proficient," I said.

"I thought it was your intent to get back into space as quickly as possible."

"It is," I said, but having access to a dome hatch might make certain business ventures possible."

"You're being devious," Christabel said.

"I'm a pirate," I said. "Pirates are devious."

"Agreed," Christabel said.

I spent the rest of the night mousing. It kept me very busy.

When dawn broke, I was glad to return to my lair. I settled down in my basket and wondered what entertainment Christabel could provide as she, that was the right pronoun, cleansed my system and fed me intravenously. It is a lengthy process with a base station. Aboard ship, I have access to a wide variety of programs, especially those from my pornographic database. I make these programs available to other androgens on a subscription basis. It is a very profitable sideline. However, Christabel had none of these programs. I thought it was silly for me to subscribe to my own database. Instead, Christabel provided a stroking program. I began to relax, to feel warm and snuggled a little deeper into my basket. I sensed her programs were based on past relationships, the way my partners had touched me and what I liked about their lovemaking. There were no memories associated with this sensory program, just the sensations. When I requested they be more sexual in character, Christabel obliged and I found that, too, not pictured in my mind but satisfying. As sunlight began streaming into my lair, I slept.

Chapter Four
Staff Meeting

Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) woke me just before eleven o'clock local time. It was not anywhere's near enough sleep for me. There was a staff meeting. I was expected to be present. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) apologized for not telling me earlier. I was free to sleep after the meeting was over.

I went upstairs using the jump lift and walked across the hallway to a conference room. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) and two other people sat at the round table. There was a threadbare carpet on the floor, a antiquated work station on a side table. The windows overlooked Front Street I was on the third floor.

"Is that the lift?" Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) asked excitedly.
"Yes," I said. "It was not difficult to locate. I ran a diagnostic program and it checks out okay. I used it last night to go to each floor of this building and to get out onto the roof."

"The roof," the woman whose name was Gail Jeffrey's, exclaimed. "What were you doing on the roof?"

"My job here is night security guard," I said. "The roof is a good place to see what is going on in the area around this building." 

I stopped. Should I tell them about the hatches? As a pirate I make it a practice not to share more information than I need to. Did I need to share this?

I was saved by Gail Jeffrey's continuing to speak, all in a rush, "It must be a glorious view. Is it dangerous. Can I go up there?"

I was not certain if she was asking permission or asking me to escort her. I said, "I is a spectacular view at night. I saw the Pyramid Volcano erupting last night. My concern is the lack of anti-grav belts. If there's a severe quake, anyone on that roof could fall."

"Do you plan to go up there every night?" Stephen Silk asked.

I considered my answer. "I believe that depends on the level of threat," I said. "You want a security guard at night. This suggests you are afraid of something or you have something of value to protect."

Stephen Silk turned to Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe). "Can we trust it?"

"Captain Star Runner can hear and understand you," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said.

"Well," Stephen Silk repeatedly in a harsh voice.He did not seem to care that I might be offended or that I heard this exchange.

"Yes," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. She turned to me. "Stephen Silk is the person in charge here. Gail Jeffrey is his wife. Stephen was my professor at the University of the Mind on Socrates--where Tamara went to school. We came here to set up a library of all Terran knowledge and as many artifacts as we can find. We are concerned that, in the Coalition, Terran knowledge is not--"

"Isn't respected by you cats," Stephen Silk interrupted.

"Stephen," Gail Jeffrey's  exclaimed.

Gail Jeffrey's, I thought, does a lot of exclaiming.

"We're expecting more people to come and help," Gail Jeffrey added.

"So this is a Terry library," I said.

"Most definitely," Stephen Silk said.

"And you're setting it up on Hypatia so that it is outside Coalition space," I said.

"That's right. The powers that be here on Hypatia assure me it will be safe."

"Safe," I repeated. "Safe from who?"

"The cats," Stephen Silk said.

"So you have engaged me to protect you from other members of The Race?" I asked.

"So it would seem," Stephen Silk said. "Zora here says you can be trusted."

"I am a Star Runner," I said. "My ship was destroyed at Over the Moon in the explosion. I am waiting for my new ship to be built. In the meantime, I needed a place to stay and this opportunity seems best for me. I cannot protect you from The Race if an organized attempt was made to interfere with your library. However, the League of Hypatian Pirates and the investors here in Ptolemy City and elsewhere in the Pharaoh Star System do not want the Pantheran Empire extending its influence in this direction. That has not happened in over a century. I doubt anything will happen in the short term to change the status quo."

"You used the word 'empire'," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said.

"Because that is what we call it," I said. "The Coalition is a word for outsiders."

"That explains a lot," Stephen Silk said.

"Yes," I said. "I am a member of The Race by design. However, I am not numbered as one of The Race at the current time."

"What does that mean
" Gail Jeffrey asked.

"It means I have been officially terminated without losing my life. I am banished from Coalition space. Should I return, I would be terminated physically."

"And by terminated you mean killed," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said.

"That is correct," I said.

Stephen Silk sat back in his chair.

"So it is in your best interest," Stephen Silk said, "as well as ours that the cats don't nose around here."

"Correct," I said.

"Okay," Stephen silk said. "Now hat we've settled things--to get back to your question about security--"

"Yes," I said.

"We are concerned," Stephen Silk said. "We expect a delivery shortly. We have also heard rumors--nothing substantive--that there are parties interested in it."

"They want to steal it from you or purchase the goods" I asked.

"Steal," Stephen Silk promptly. "And by force if necessary. As you know, there aren't too many ways we can move the items from the spaceport to here. We're quite vulnerable in that way."

"There might be an alternative," I said. "It will require some investigation."

"An alternative to ground transportation" Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) asked. "I thought you could use a hovercraft too close to the dome. I don't see how we could ravel any other way."

"Are you aware," I asked, "that these warehouses are built so that cargo can be moved in and out through the roof?"

"Really?" Gail Jeffrey asked. "How?"

Stephen Silk leaned forward.

"You know of an alternative route, runner?"

"Star Runner," I said. "I am not called just Runner."

"Tamara called it Star," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "I wonder if we could call you that."

"That would be fine," I said.

"Do you know of a way to move the items, Star," Stephen Silk repeated.

"I might," I said. "I can show you tonight if that is time enough. I would like to get some more sleep. have my purchases come from the chandlery?"

"Yes," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "We can help you put up the curtains and lay the rug right now so you can get back to sleep. You look very tired."

"I am," I said. "I am still working things out with my new AI. Christabel is learning quickly, but it is not as smooth as my shipboard AI which was destroyed."

"That must have been very upsetting," Gail Jeffrey offered.

"It was," I said \.

Chapter Five
Security Matters

I woke in the late afternoon. The improvements I had made to my lair helped make the room more comfortable. After a through wash, I went in search of Stephen Silk. Many things about the library's security arrangements puzzled me. Perhaps it was not my job, but I wanted to understand why Stephen Silk did not employ security cameras and a detection system. Because of the nature of my cargos, I routinely invested in the latest security protocols aboard my ship. I used locks, passwords, cameras, proximity alarms, intruder alerts and much encryption. In fact, my brain was encrypted with some of the best routines money could buy--from the Fungusians who were the best hackers and security experts in this part of the galaxy. 

I found Stephen Silk sitting in a chair behind a desk looking at an antiquated computer monitor.

"What is it, cat?" Stephen Silk asked.

I would describe his mood as irritated.

I matched his distaste of me with my distaste of him. I hissed before speaking. "I am not a cat," I said. "I am a Pantheran."

My hiss surprised him, not in a pleasant way. I made a point of raising my right paw and extending my claws. I did not consider this a threatening gesture. I simply wanted Stephen Silk to remember I am a large individual who can both defend and attack. Terries need tools to do the same. They pride themselves on their tool-making ability, The Race prides itself on physical strength which even among the genetically engineered androgens such as I is maintained as a matter of species identity. This is something Terries do not understand. They have always remarked that we are large animals and why were we not miniaturized to perform our functions. We would not be Pantherans, members of a proud race, if we were modified in that way. We are not pets. We are not toys. We may not be gendered or free to live to old age, but we retain our teeth, our claws and our voices.

"I'll amend my question. What do you want, Pantheran," Stephen Silk asked, emphasizing the word Pantheran.

"You have hired me as a night security guard," I said. "I was given no weapon with which to defend myself. Nor do I find you using any security protocols except locking the door with a rather flimsy lock. I am puzzled by this because you said earlier today you were expecting an important delivery which might be stolen. I came to get an explanation."

"Night watchmen don't usually ask such questions," Stephen Silk said. "Why do you want to know."

A human expression came unbidden into my mind. It must be  Christabel's doing. This AI had a sense of humor. I thought we were going to get along well. I must inform the Fungusians to incorporate her into my next shipboard system.

"You Terries have a saying," I said, "Curiosity killed the cat. I believe that is why I want to know. Besides, I am not unfamiliar with security systems. I operate solo and I rely on many security protocols to keep both my cargo and my being safe. I also would have thought these warehouses would have had some sort of security system even though it would be very old."

"It does," Stephen Silk said and sighed. "There are cameras and computers. However, there's no manual."

"Like the jump tube" I asked.

"Like the jump tube." Stephen Silk sighed again. "Pantheran, if you can get it working, more power to you. I'm a librarian and a researcher. I want to set up a library, not fool with security systems. Can you work one of these?"

Stephen Silk pushed the computer's keyboard toward me.

"Christabel," I said. "I can press keys on a Terry computer if I have to, but is there a way to interface?"

"You'll need a cable from the lair," Christabel replied.

"I need a cable from my lair," I told Stephen Silk. "I will return promptly. You may watch."

the cable connected me to the warehouse's central computer through the work station. Stephen Silk express shock.

"You're wired to our computer?"

"indeed," I said. "there are lots of old records here on what used to be stored here, financial transactions, employee records, old computer games, lots of messages sent to individuals, that sort of thing. Ah, yes, here's your security system. It's dormant. My AI is running diagnostics on it right now. She is also messaging to her manufacturer for more subroutines. Christabel will be updated in a day or two to be better able to understand the system. Christabel has set up a partition in your central computer for herself. The diagnostic run is speeding up now.. The report is coming to me. Christabel, display on screen for Stephen Silk to see."

I, of course, could see more, linked as I was to both Christabel and the central computer. In theory, at least, the security system had both internal and external cameras, alarms, motion sensors and locks. I began turning the cameras on and routing their images to me. Christabel and I were working smoothly together. Since our bond was growing, I was able to work quickly. Many of the internal cameras were dysfunctional. I flagged them for later examination. They may not be either useful or in the needed areas. I did not need to spy on the Terries living in the building. I made certain they could not spy on me. The cameras in my lair and its environs were working. I encrypted them. Stephen Silk was still reading his screen. he had made no sign he wanted more information.

"What does this report say?" Stephen Silk finally asked.

"That many of the security cameras are not functional," I said. "A physical inspection will be necessary. I may not be able to do that depending on their locations. I can give you a view of who is knocking at your door. I can see both pirate's Close and Thieves' Alley. I don't have good coverage on Front Street or the rear of the building. I only have a few cameras operational on the roof. I'm worried about these cameras."

"Why?"

"Because," I said, "originally, cargo came in and out of this building from the roof. I have a feed for the jump tube. The freight tube is not functional but now I know where it is. I will have to see if it is working. It's all dark from in here."


"And you can see all that?" Stephen Silk was incredulous.

"Of course," I said. "That is what I am designed to do--interface with computers. I do not know a great deal about inventory control, for example, and you have lots of data and programs for that. I am designed to run a starship. However, both warehouses and starships have security systems. If you want me to be in touch with your security system while I move about, I will need to have my base station and your computer connected. I will put in safeguards so my own system is not compromised. I would only interface while on duty or during an emergency. My assumption is that you will want to keep library records on the computer and you would not want me to have access to them."

'That would be correct," Stephen Silk said. 

"I do not want you to have access to my systems," I said.

"I would think not," Stephen Silk said. Then he said, "Pantheran, you know I don't like your race, but I can see that you could be a great asset to this project."

"You need a Terry to handle this," I said. "I am here now and can get your security system working. I want no part of the library or cleaning out your central computer from when it was a warehouse. When my ship is delivered, I will be space borne again and back to running my own business."

"And you will show us the roof after dark?" Stephen Silk said.

"I will."

"I've checked the quake forecast," Stephen Silk said, "we could be in for a rough night."

"A quake forecast?" I asked.

"There's a weather forecast of sorts," Stephen Silk said, "to let the residents of Ptolemy City know if there will be severe shaking. Weren't you aware of it?"

"No," I said. "I was not. Weather is not something I am accustomed to."

Christabel located the report and said she would monitor it from now on. We would have a rough spell on he roof if we went up too late. An anti-grav belt seemed a higher priority. it was part of my standard gear aboard ship so I issued Christabel a lower priority directive to review the available models. In turn, she sent off an out-of-the Pharaoh-star-system request for one suited to my dimensions and space board life. In the meantime, I could use an anti grav drape.

"Ah," I told Stephen Silk, "Gail Jeffrey and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) are walking along Front Street and they are about to turn into Pirate's Close. They have packages. I will open the door for them--now."

Chapter Six
Up on the Roof Again

We assembled in the conference room after dark. I had the anti-grav drape with me. I was a bit heavy and a bit awkward. It was like wearing a blanket cinched around my middle. hardly a fashion statement. I wondered who of my friends had said that. The circumstances were missing from my memory. the phrase remained. The drape was typically placed under bodies and then folded over them. Both medical personnel and morticians used them. It would keep me from needing either one of individuals should I fall from the roof.

I showed each one of them how to operate the jump tube. they each tried it for one floor, then took the stairs. I noted with interest that Stephen Silk had been the most nervous.. This was not a Terry with a lot of personal physical courage. I would have to ask my Terry friends if people who went to university were like this or was this peculiar to Stephen Silk himself. I directed Christabel to keep this question in a face-to-face file. I need not send off a message right now. It was not necessary. I continued to be pleased with our growing rapport.

  We gathered near the center of the roof. I opened the stairwell hatch from the outside. The three Terries proceeded to step out onto the roof gingerly, looking about them nervously. We were a considerable distance from the roof's edge in any direction. Again tonight the display of lava from the Pyramid Volcano was spectacular. The Gail Jeffrey's and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) made little noises which Christabel interpreted as both pleasure and excitement.

"Isn't it beautiful, Stephen?" Gail Jeffrey's asked.

"It is amazing," he said. "How high is that plume, Pantheran?"

"I understand the average height is four hundred thirty-seven point seventy-three kilometers," I said. The volcano itself is approximately one hundred twenty-five kilometers away from us."

Tonight the colors changed constantly. The night was again clear. I saw no ore freighters.

The base on which Ptolemy City is built kept stabilizing itself. The roof trembled constantly. It caused the Terries to stagger a bit. My anti-grave drape kept me stable. I was several centimeters off the roof, floating so as not to be affected by the changes. As the quakes increased in intensity, both Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) AND Gail Jeffrey's decided to return to their quarters. Stephen Silk, however, despite his fear stayed on the roof. I could smell his fear. He was perspiring, breathing more quickly, clenching and unclenching his hands.

"Do you walk around the roof on your watch" Stephen Silk asked.

"Yes, of course," I said. "I need to check for cameras and there state of repair."

"I will join you," Stephen Silk said.

I thought this was odd, especially since Stephen Silk was so fearful, but I put it down to wanting to appear competent after our conversation of earlier in the afternoon. I padded to the edge of the roof by Thieves' Alley and began pacing along toward the rear of the building, noting the camera locations as I went. A number of the cameras were smashed. I noted their locations and let Christabel describe their appearance. I could manually turn on several cameras as we walked along the rear alleyway. Stephen Silk walked next to me so that I was on the outside and he was on the inside. My bulk seemed to calm him. We continued along Pirate's Close, noting that a string of cameras were entirely missing.

"I don't get it," Stephen Silk said. "What happened?"

"Probably theft," I said. "or the owner wanted to use them elsewhere. The smashed ones look like vandalism or sabotage. Whatever happened, it happened some time ago. This activity was not directed at the library."

We came to Front Street. More of the cameras were in good order here. I noted the ones that were inoperable. 

I was just leaning over a camera that seemed to be in tact but was not working when a particularly violent quake shook the warehouse. Stephen Silk lost his balance, slamming into me. The force of his body hitting mine was sufficient for me to lose my balance. I was standing with three paws on the roof and one extended to press the service mechanism for the camera. The impact pushed me over the edge of the roof. Stephen grabbed hold of me and together we began to fall toward Front Street. Stephen Silk screamed.

The drape is not intended for the purpose to which I purposed it. It certainly could not support both my weight and Stephen Silk's considerable mass. He was lying across me, his arms tightly clasped around my neck. Our position was quite precarious. We were falling, but at a much slower rate of descent. The anti-grav unit was working. I heard it protest the weight. My fear was that the unit would burn out before we reached the ground. At this rate our impact would be noticeable but not fatal. As we fell, Stephen Silk's grasp grew tighter and tighter. I wondered if I would smother before we crashed.

"Do something, Pantheran," Stephen Silk ordered.

I did not reply. In fact, I do not think I could have replied. My throat felt closed.

We were coming down far too quickly. I know it is a Terry axiom that cats always land on their feet. In general, this is true of members of The Race, too. However, I was unbalanced. It would be wiser for me to roll when I hit the pavement. However, I could not do that with Stephen Silk on top of me. I bent my knees and waited.

A half meter from the ground, the anti-grav whined horribly, then we came to a halt. It jerked by body suddenly. Stephen Silk lost his grip and fell to the ground. I realized was not completely held in place. I was sinking slowly. This must be some sort of safety mechanism. I found a control and let myself down a little more quickly.

Stephen Silk was lying on his back on the street. I released the drape and padded over to him. Stephen Silk was not moving. Christabel did a scan.

"He is alive," my AI reported. "He is unconscious. He requires medical treatment."

Christabel summoned an ambulance.

It took some time for it to arrive. I stayed with Stephen Silk. There was no traffic so he was in no danger lying in the street.

A medical robot emerged from the ambulance Caravan.

"Your name," the robot asked.

"I am Captain Star Runner," I said. "This is Stephen Silk. A quake threw us off the roof of 3274 Front Street. I had an anti-grav drape on. Stephen Silk attached himself to me. At our final descent, the brakes on the anti-grav drape threw him off me. I am undamaged."

"Very well," the robot said. "Mr. Silk requires hospitalization. We will take him. Next of kin?"

"Gail Jeffrey's at the same address," I said.

"Very well," the robot said. "Do you require any medical attention"

"negative," I said."My AI will attend me."

"Very well," the robot said.

"The robot retrieved an anti-grav stretcher and Stephen Silk was carried into the ambulance. The Caravan sped away.

As I padded down Pirate's Close, the door of the library bumped open. Gail Jeffrey's and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) burst through it and started running in my direction. They could not, of course, pass me. Gail Jeffrey's stopped in front of me.

"What happened?": Gail Jeffrey's demanded. "Where is Stephen? Is he hurt?"

"We fell off the roof," I said.

Gail Jeffrey's screamed.

"Is he dead?" Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) asked.

"No," I said. "He is unconscious. Stephen Silk grabbed hold of me and my anti-grav drape slowed our progress to Front Street. The ambulance has come and taken Stephen Silk to the hospital."

"Which one?" Gail Jeffrey's asked.

"There is only one hospital in Ptolemy City," I said. "Asclepius Medical Center is on its own space station."

"Get out of my way," Gail Jeffrey's said. "I must go to the hospital."

"I can't reverse very well," I said. "It would be quicker if you two returned to the library and I went past the door. Please go quickly."

Surprisingly, for Terries can be very stubborn, they did as they were told. I ran around the corner and heard them running toward Front Street. I wondered if there would be a caravan nearby for them to take to the hospital. I supposed I ought to be more concerned, but I was not. It was foolish for Stephen Silk to walk so close to the edge of the roof on a high quake day without an anti-grav unit. My drape had been successful in shielding me from a nasty fall. I knew from Christabel's analysis that the braking near the ground would make me sore and uncomfortable tomorrow. Chemical formulas passed by me at the edge of my consciousness. Christabel was designing a regimen of biochemical's to ease my pain as much as possible and repair the damage. My intravenous feeding would be quite complicated when I returned to my lair.

The women did not return to the library that night. No other significant things happened to log overnight. When dawn came, I left the security cameras, such as they were, on with an alarm to wake me should anything or anyone approach the library while I slept.

Chapter Seven
The Library Interior

When I woke, the women had not returned. Christabel queried Stephen Silk's status at Ptolemy City Hospital. He was listed in stable condition.

I had several hours before I went on duty. I decided to examine the inside of the warehouse. My duties as security guard were to monitor the exterior. However, I decided I needed to know abut the interior space. I am naturally curious. This sometimes gets me in trouble. On the other hand, I had questions. Besides, I needed more information about the freight elevator.

I went to the highest level of the warehouse. This was where the receiving area was located. The stairwell exit onto the roof was part of a larger hatch which literally opened the roof up with doors swinging upward away from the warehouse. The stairwell formed part of a catwalk just outside this opening under the roof. From this platform I saw many mechanisms which in general I understood as controlling cargo as it was lowered from above onto the floor or raised up. Given the sections of the roof which would be vertical, I surmised the cargo was either laced on anti-grav pallets or, and this seemed more likely given all the mechanisms, on passive pallets held up by some sort of craft that would ferry it to the exterior hatch I had scene two nights ago in the dome. The fright ferry--Christabel thought the word might be barge--was loaded, flew to the roof and then the cargo was attached to cables and lowered into the warehouse. Conversely, the cargo waiting to be shipped out of the warehouse could leave it in basically the same way. It was impossible at this point, and maybe of no interest, whether this warehouse both imported and exported cargo or did one or the other. If it received cargo, it would need a distribution system to Ptolemy City itself. If it exported cargo, where did it come from? This would mean perusing the central computer. I set up an ethical routine to decide how much snooping I would do into the central computer. At the moment, I was only monitoring the security systems which were woefully inadequate according to modern standards.

Next, I went to the freight jump tube which was merely a larger version of the passenger jump tube. My diagnostic showed it was inoperable. It only went as far as this floor. Again, part of the floor swung away so that the items needing to be moved could fall, in a controlled manner, to another floor. The awkwardness of this system indicated why a mechanical system had been arranged for the barges. It was a very low-powered jump tube. The mechanical system would have been much faster. A good idea if the barge was part of a pickup and delivery contract. I wondered if the items that would be housed in this library were large, heavy and awkward or if they would simply be data modules. I had never been to a physical library. At the Institute, all data was retrieved electronically and through our personal AI's.

Besides the jump tubes and stairwell, there were a few computer work station outlets and a lot of smashed security cameras on this level but not much else. The top level of the warehouse was dusty and dirty and Finally  there was the basement. I made a recognizance here. The central computer was located here and the heating and cooling system.

I knew nothing about computers from the outside. I depended on others to build and maintain them. I was nervous about the cables Christabel had instructed me to use. I was more comfortable with wireless systems.

Christabel kept updating our map of the interior space. She found an empty area against the front wall. We wondered if this was another jump tube. How did all this equipment get into the basement. it would not fit down the stairs or the personal jump tube. When I went there, I found a pair of metal doors with no handles to open them. They did not automatically open either. Christabel identified this as an elevator, a mechanical lifting device. I was unfamiliar with an elevator. Christabel advised that such a device was common in Terry parlance and must not be used unless it received regular maintenance. It seemed very unlikely this elevator had received any maintenance in decades.

Chapter Nine
Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe)


When I vaulted out into the foyer from the jump tube, I saw Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) with her arms around Gail Jeffrey's.

"Gail," she was saying, "you know the medical robot and the review board at the hospital cleared Captain Star Runner of any wrongdoing in Stephen's accident."

Gail was crying. "I know that, Zoe," she said. "But on this awful world, killing is not a crime. How do we know that awful animal didn't push Stephen off the roof."

"Why would I do that?" I asked.

They had not heard me arrive.

Gail Jeffrey's whirled. "You beast," she exclaimed. "How dare you eavesdrop on our conversation."

"I simply came upstairs to inquire how Stephen Silk is," I searched for the correct word, "doing. I decided this was a vague term but might cover a lot of possibilities.

"He is still in the hospital," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "He has a concussion and several broken bones. He will be in the hospital until he regains consciousness."

"I know it's your fault," Gail Jeffrey's said, pointing a finger at me. "If it were up to me, you would be in jail."

"Ptolemy City has no jail," I said. I refrained from adding that anyone who required imprisonment was either banished from the planet or exiled to the Fends.

"I'm going upstairs," Gail Jeffrey's announced and walked haughtily to the stairs. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) did not follow her. "Are you coming, Zoe?" Gail Jeffrey's asked when she perceived she was alone.

"I'm going to have a word with Captain Star Runner," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "I'll be with you shortly, Gail. have something to eat."

Turning to me, Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said, "Captain Star Runner, I apologize for Gail's outburst. She is overwrought. She and Stephen are very close and Gail, well, Gail is not a strong person. She depends enormously on Stephen. His accident is very difficult for her. Please excuse her accusations. The quakes were quite severe last night. It's a miracle Stephen was not hurt more seriously."

"I'm sorry Stephen Silk was injured," I said. "I am glad to hear the medical robots consider he will make a full recovery."

"They do," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said, "if he regains consciousness soon. They anticipate it will be in a few hours."

"Very good," I said. "Please notify me of any change in his condition at any time. My AI will hold the message if I'm asleep and it is not an emergency."

"I will," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "If you'll excuse me, Captain Star Runner, I should--"

"One moment," I said. "Stephen Silk indicated he was expecting some items for the library shortly and that there might be a problem with their delivery. Do you know anything about this?"

"Oh, no," Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) said. "That's not my area of expertise."

"And what is your area of expertise?" I asked.

"Oh, I'm the cataloger. I'll also arrange where the items will be kept. Stephen deals with acquisitions. Captain, I really must go to Gail and make sure she eats and rests. I will notify you of any change in Stephen's condition."

And she, too, left the foyer.

Christabel and I conferred. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe)'s denial of knowing anything about the expected delivery did not ring true for either Christabel or me. She has hesitated just a little too long. Her breathing had quickened. She had spoken just a little too quickly. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) was lying, but what she was lying about I did not know. This bore watching. 

Chapter Ten 
I Decide to Ask Some Questions

I examined the area of the wall on Front Street where Christabel and I thought the Terry elevator should open onto the street. 

It was boarded up. We both had assumed it was a window, though in retrospect it was a window at ground level and quite large. Neither of us were very familiar with Terry architecture. We wondered that the door to the building was down Pirate's Alley while the freight elevator was here on Front Street. Perhaps a guard had been posted. Perhaps the door was locked except when there was a delivery. 

Whatever the explanation, this area must be a concern for me. All the security cameras in this area were inoperable. The building was very vulnerable here.

As I reviewed today's revelations, I pondered the names of the alleys--Pirate's Close and Thieves' Alley. Perhaps they were whimsical. Perhaps they indicated what went on here in the past. I wondered about the other warehouses in the area. How could I find out if they were occupied?

It occurred to me not for the first time that all of these questions did not concern me. I got a room in the basement of an almost derelict building in an out-of-the-way part of Ptolemy city in exchange for monitoring the exterior of one building. I need not do anything else. What the Terries did inside this building was of no concern to me. If they wanted to make a library--if that was the right word--that was their business. That is how things go on Hypatia. People do whatever they want. As Gail Jeffrey's said, it is not illegal to kill people on Hypatia. Emily Dickinson is a professional assassin. His legal difficulties right now have to do with slander, not murder. 

I should visit him soon even though it means going near water. I dislike water very much. It is something I can typically avoid by only frequenting space stations and spaceships. Unfortunately, my life is different right now. Emily Dickinson is a friend. He has been a lover. The lover part of our relationship is over. It has been over for some time. I do not currently remember anything about our time as lovers. It is not part of Christabel's memory library. I do know we had a disagreement and we are no longer lovers. We are friends. I do not know much about that either. It is simply a fact. I accept it. Not knowing, not remembering, is becoming more and more an inconvenience. I had not realized how important my memories are to daily living. I would not have thought memories of people were very important before the accident but now I know. I must remember to have a contingency plan in future.  

I went up onto the roof. A regular walk around its outer limits gave me a good view of the alleys and Front Street. I checked the status of he quakes. The forecast said it would be a mild night. I retrieved my drape to be on the safe side.

Then Christabel and I did some very serious thinking.

I decided I enjoyed my new AI. Ship and I had meshed well. My first shipboard AI had been very simple. As I added more routines, it could do more. I meshed with a military AI. I modified some of its routines. It gave me a very robust AI. Christabel, however, was more like a friend. It was less like talking to myself. I liked this. The truth was, I was feeling very lonely. Although I had Terry friends, Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe), Gail Jeffrey's and Stephen Silk did not seem like my Terry friends at all. I did not have a lot of data to work with. nevertheless, they did not feel right. 

"One," I said to Christabel, "I need to talk things over with Emily Dickinson. He will set me straight about certain things."

Christabel had a summary of Emily Dickinson. It indicated he made a habit of correcting my ideas in a no nonsense sort of manner. I wondered what it would be like. I could only be confident I did not dislike it.

"Two," I said, "I need to contact Tamara. I only know from Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) that she is a friend of Tamara. I did not question this before. I believed what she told me. However, after her remarks this evening, I wonder if it is true. I have no way of verifying it for myself. Christabel, compose a priority message to Tamara explaining briefly what has happened and asking her if she is friends with this Zoe person and what she can tell me about her. Ask her about Gail Jeffrey's and Stephen Silk as well."

"Three," I continued, sensing Christabel was preparing the message to Tamara as a background process, "scan all public records on Hypatia to see what you can learn about these Terries, this library and this warehouse."

I knew what my fourth item was. It was about the shipment Stephen Silk was expecting. How had he known of a rumor that it would be stolen?

"Four," I said, "contact the League of Hypatian Pirates--their main office. Ask for any information concerning the library. Tell them I have a personal interest in this matter."
 
That meant it would be assumed that either my well-being or financial interest was at stake. In a way, it was.
--all submerged or piled up. Dirt has been placed over these mounds. Rough cabins had been built
This done, and dawn making its way across the dome, I retired to my lair.

Chapter Eleven
I Visit Emily Dickinson

Mid afternoon, I headed out to the Fends. This area was the worst area of the dome. It was where the recycling systems for Ptolemy City were located--sewer, water, air, trash. Water circulated--fairly clean water--at least, not toxic. There were islets, mounds of garbage or abandoned pieces of caravan, ground car, boat
on them,one per islet. These were used as a makeshift prison. For the few offenses prosecutable on Hypatia, and for those who had no place else to go. No connectivity to the local network was allowed

I had no information on Emily Dickinson's case. I simply knew he was not at his apartment. A message on his voice mail and on his door read, he was unavailable for twelve weeks. This was week five. Seven more to go.

The bad smells grew more intense the closer I got to the Fends. It also got damper. I hate water. I hate water. As a space station raised individual, standing water is an anathema to me. Planet side, it always seems there is water--standing water, moving water, water that makes noise. The North Sea had been more water than I ever want to see again, ever.

The path--it would be an exaggeration to call it a sidewalk--became wet. Water from the Fends sloshed over it at irregular intervals. I stepped gingerly, shaking the water from my paws. How did one get to the islets?

A man came toward him, swinging a stick, muttering to himself.

"A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse." He repeated this over and over again. Christabel had to show me a picture of a horse for me to understand he meant an animal used for conveyance. How strange, but then again, Terries were strange creatures--keeping pets, riding horses, wearing clothes. And they thought members of The Race were strange for not wearing clothes, especially the gendered members of my race.

"Sir," I said. Terries liked this form of address. "Sir, please tell me how I may locate a resident and journey to his residence."

"Do you have a horse?" the man asked, stopping, but continuing to swing his stick.

"No, sir," I said. "I do not."

He looked at me carefully.

"Can I ride you?" he asked.

It was a serious question. I considered. "I do not know," I said.

"Have you a saddle?"

Christabel flashed a picture of a saddle and showed me it went on the back of the horse.

"No, sir," I said. "When I have one, I pilot a spaceship. I'm a star runner, not a horse."

"Oh, pity," he said. "I need a horse."

He made as if to walk past me.

"How do I find Emily Dickinson," I asked, deciding the direct approach might gain me a better response. Specificity might get his attention.

"An unremarkable poet, my lad," he said. "I prefer the classics--Homer, Shakespeare, even Virgil is better."

"Emily Dickinson is a resident here," I said, "temporarily."

"Riffraff," the man exclaimed.

"No, sir," I said. "a professional assassin. Here for slander as I understand."

"An assassin," he asked. For the first time, he seemed interested.

"Yes, and a good one," I said.

"Who do you want killed?"

"No one," I said.

"Then why do you need an assassin?"

"I do not," I said. "Emily Dickinson is my friend. I came to visit him."

"Hard to visit those on the islands," he said.

"Yes," I said. "But I thought you might know how to cross the water"

"Swim."

"No, sir," I said. "I am a cat--water, you know."

"Ah, yes," he said. "You do not like to get your paws wet."

"That is correct," I said. "I wonder if there was a boat."

"Foot bridge," he said. "very civilized."

He pointed down the path with his stick.

"That way."

"Thank you, sir," I said, and padded past him. Behind me I heard him resume, "A horse. A Horse. A kingdom for my horse."

Obviously, this man was one of the unfortunates who lived in the Fends permanently.

But, true to his word, there was a footbridge which led onto one of the islands. A fairly large building was here. Over the doorway a sign read: King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road.

"Richard III was king of a place called England," Christabel reported. "In a play he is quoted as saying, 'my horse. my horse. My kingdom for a horse.'"

Perhaps then the man I met was Richard I.

"Pussy cat," I heard a familiar voice call. "What are you doing on King Richard's Island?"

I looked. Across a narrow strip of water stood Emily Dickinson. I went to him, considered the water, moved back and jumped across. It was a close thing, but I did not get wet.

"I met King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, as I came here to visit you," I said. "He asked me if I had a horse and then if I could be ridden. I declined, but then he pointed me in this direction."

"He's quite mad," Emily Dickinson said.

"So I gathered," I said.

"What brings you here to the Fends, pussy cat?"

"I came to see you," I said. "I, too, am marooned, having lost my The Three Little Kittens in the space station explosion."

"No kidding," Emily Dickinson said. "Were you injured."

"I was planet side at the time," I said, "my transceiver was able to shield me from the shipboard explosion. Now I'm using a base station with a new AI named Christabel. She is quite good. Unfortunately, a lot of my memory banks are not available."

"So I can lie to you," Emily Dickinson said.

"To a point," I said. "I think there are algorithms to tell me when you are taking advantage of the situation though I frankly cannot be certain. That is why I came, to ask you some questions."

"then come into my stellar abode,"Emily Dickinson said. "I did not think I would miss anyone, pussy cat, but I'm glad to have you here."

I followed Emily Dickinson into the cabin. It was one room, with table, bunk and mini kitchen. He sat on the bunk. I sat on the floor.

So are your mushroom friends building you a new ship?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"The Plumies are building the ship. The Fungusians are designing the ship's systems," I said. "I still do not have a delivery date."

"So what are you doing in the meantime?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"I am working as a night security guard at a warehouse in the commercial district, 1172 Front Street, near Stockade Street. Three people are there. They are starting a library. Their names are Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey's and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe). Two nights ago Stephen Silk and I were thrown off the roof by a quake. I had an anti-grav drape on. He grabbed hold of me, but he was knocked off when the brakes engaged near the sidewalk. He is in Ptolemy City Hospital. His wife, Gail Jeffrey's, thinks it is my fault, that I was trying to kill him. Of course the authorities did not do anything about it. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) claims to be one of Tamara's friends from the University of the Mind on Socrates. I have sent Tamara a message to confirm this. A conversation we had yesterday concerns me.

"What conversation?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"Stephen Silk told me he was expecting some items for his library but he had heard rumors someone wants to steal the items. This woman they call Zoe told me she knew nothing about the items or the rumors. Christabel and I think she is lying."

"So this AI has a name more than Ship," Emily Dickinson said.

"She said her name is Christabel," I said. "She came with it."

"And your question," Emily Dickinson prompted.

"My question is," I said, "who would you think would be interested in some items coming to a library--an empty library by the way."

"Sounds like a front," Emily Dickinson said. "Say you're going to set up a library. Bring in some people. And do something entirely different."

"Stephen Silk told me they wanted to set up a library here to have information the Pantheran Empire wants suppressed."

"So you're calling it an empire," Emily Dickinson said, stretching out his long legs.

"I always have," I said. "I use Coalition with terries. You seem to like it better."

"It's a lie, you know, the Coalition," Emily Dickinson said. There was no heat behind his words. It was just an observation.

"I have always known that," I said.

"I've known it since my days in Military Intelligence," Emily Dickinson said. "But that doesn't help you figure out what's going on there. I take it you took the job while you're waiting for your new ship."

"I needed a place to stay," I said.

"You have your base station there" Emily Dickinson asked.

"Yes," I said.

"You may want to move it," Emily Dickinson said. "I know there are reasons why you can't stay at my old place, but I think you can petition the authorities to put your base station there. I think you can boost the signal sufficiently so it won't cause you any trouble."

"But my bio feeds," I said.

"Hmm," Emily Dickinson said. "I forgot about that. Maybe you could petition the authorities to stay at my place."

"I do not know why I cannot stay there," I said. "I did not stay there because I know we are no longer lovers."

"Yes," Emily Dickinson said. "That is true. However, if we reconcile you could claim we've moved back in together and so you can go to my apartment. You per diem would go for rent. is that okay with you?"

"Well, yes, I suppose so. Do you really think it is necessary?"

"Yes, I do. I don't want you and Christabel to have any problems. Besides, a threesome could be interesting when I get back. I like the idea of being in bed with Christabel." he smiled. I did not react.

"You don't remember," Emily Dickinson said.

"Remember what?" I asked."You know I do not remember."

"We were quite a couple, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said. "But you record everything and decided to upload some of our better times to your database and sell them. I took exception to that. You offered to share the profits with me. I said that wasn't the point. It was a matter of privacy which you did not understand. It was a rough patch we went through. We got over it, bit by bit. That was some time ago. I think your ethical subroutines are getting better--at least, they are getting more sensitive to Terran sensibilities."

"Ah," I said. "So you think I should go to your apartment?"

"You'll need to have it unsealed. Have your girl friend Christabel send an official request. I'm pretty sure you can do it. The thing is that they don't want you bringing me stuff to make this little vacation comfortable."

"Oh, I said. I see."

"They ;might even picked up your transmissions to the base station while you're here so don't be surprised if the fuzz comes around.'
"

"Fuzz?" I asked.

"Police."

"What makes you so suspicious?" I asked.

"When we were chasing that Phani girl around," Emily Dickinson said, "Gyllie and I ended up in a bar with some of our old cronies from the military intelligence unit. There's word out of a group that's trying to break away from the Empire--a Terran group that thinks it can crack the Empire wide open. That's crazy of course. Empires do indeed rise and fall, but the Pantheran Empire has been I charge for a long time and is showing no signs of crumbling. It probably engineered the independence movements on the northern and southern frontiers and for all I know underwrites Hypatia. If the other races don't think they're being subjected, they won't give the Empire much trouble. The renegades will get out of the main shipping routes and let the Pantheran Empire concentrate on the business of expanding westward and controlling the lucrative star systems. Terrans can blow off steam in places like this. Maybe they can even catch some of the rebels here."

I considered what Emily Dickinson had to say. I still wasn't sure what he meant by all of it and what he thought I ought to do. I was not at all certain. I would need to rethink everything.

Chapter Twelve
Limitations

"The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"

It was King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road.

"Quick," Emily Dickinson said. "Get onto King Richard's property. He isn't a criminal. Your electronics are legal there."

I went as quickly as I could, jumping the water in between the islands. Unfortunately, I could not get as much of a running start and I got my paws wet. I did not want to think of what was in the water.

King Richard I, duke of the Gloucester Road, played his part admirably. He posed with me in front of his castle--that is what he called his shack. The police boat chugged by with its electronic snooping devices, noticed me, and kept going. When they had left, I returned to Emily Dickinson's cabin.

"I thought you said King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, was insane," I said. "He seems quite reasonable except for the business about needing a horse."

"At times, I think it is an act," Emily Dickinson said. "At other times I think it is real. Perhaps he is an undercover agent. Anything is possible on Hypatia, you know that. Perhaps he is just crazy. Anyway, I have found him to be quite harmless. He watches and let's the rest of us out here know when the police are looking for illegal wireless devices. You qualify as one. I saw what he did, treating you like a valued pet. That was quite clever of him. You played your part well, too,pussy cat. I did not know you had it in you."

"I thought I purr rather well," I said. King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, had scratched me quite pleasantly behind the ears.

"I think," I said, "it would be inconvenient and provocative if I moved out of the library. I just moved in and bought things for the room. Christabel can order a duplicate base station and we can put it in your apartment. It can be slaved to my unit in my basement lair. We can also build in safeguards so that if anything happens to the primary unit, the secondary unit will be protected. If I move out, I could lose my job and lose access."

"Hmm, you've got a point there," Emily Dickinson agreed.

"I'm also hampered by not knowing things," I complained. "I do not have my full set of memories. Maybe there is something I should know and I do not know.  

Emily Dickinson smiled at me. "So I could tell you anything about myself and you would believe it?"

"Not necessarily," I said. "I might detect you are lying but not know why or you might say or do something inconsistent with the general outline I have of our relationship."
"
"So you have an outline," Emily Dickinson said.

"Yes," I said. "An outline, but not the full record of our interactions. that is why I do not know if Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) is a real friend of Tamara's or not. I still have not received an answer from Tamara. Perhaps she is out of the office. Sometimes she goes on archeological investigations on remote planets and the messages take some time to reach her. I am becoming impatient

"What has the League told you" Emily Dickinson asked.

"That I am not directly targeted," I said. "However, they do have it on record that I am at the library should something occur. That is the protection I can give myself. They were aware of the incident with Stephen Silk."

"His falling off the roof," Emily Dickinson said.

"Yes," I said.

"Okay. Then here's what I would do, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said. "I would track down Thunder Bone Bobby and Deadly Dudley. Do you know them?"

"Only by reputation," I said. "My entries are minimal. What can you tell me?"

Thunder Bone Bobby has sticky finger. He takes things. He likes taking things. You can pay him or not. He likes doughnuts and fizzy drinks. He's happy if you give him some. He's quite good at stealing.

"Deadly Dudley is a killer. You have to pay him and quite well. He likes using a laser gun and slicing people up.

"These two work together. I don't know why and I don't know how they stand each other, but they have worked together for a long time. I think Deadly Dudley is the brains of the operation and keeps Thunder Bone from doing too much pro bono work, if you know what I mean.

"Find out if they have been in the area. Talk to them if you can. They might actually tell you something. Be careful of Deadly Dudley. He doesn't like cats, I mean, he really doesn't like cats and he may get ugly."

"Okay," I said. "Where do they hangout in Ptolemy City?"

"I'd go to the Queen Nefertiti Bar. If they're not there and no one has seen them, ask The Czarina. She may know. Ask around."

"Okay," I said. "I will have to do that tomorrow. Right now, I have to leave. I go on duty soon."

I got up. Emily Dickinson reached out and ran his fingers down my nose.

"Thank you," I said. "I will let you know what I find out. Can I get a message to King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road?"

Well, maybe Emily Dickinson and I would be on again and having a conveniently placed base station in his apartment would be useful.

Limitations. I was confounded on every side by limitations.

Chapter Thirteen
I Go to Shepheard's Hotel

Next day, I made my way in a different direction, climbing aboard one of the Camels and traveling to Shepheard's Hotel. In the afternoon, the Nefertiti Bar was fairly empty. Neither the bartender nor any of the patrons knew where Thunder Bone Bobby or Deadly Dudley were. They had not come into the Queen Nefertiti Bar at any time as far as anyone could tell me.

I went to the Terrace. I do not especially like the Terrace. It is a high rectangular room with a glass wall which looks out of the dome onto the landscape of Hypatia. It is far too open a view for me. It makes me very ill-at-ease.

However, I did find the Czarina at her usual table.

"Captain Star Runner," she cried, "How good to see you. How is your job as a librarian?"

"I am not a librarian," I said, "I am a night security guard. This is not nighttime so I am officially off duty. I came to ask you some questions."

"You are so direct," the Czarina said. "It always thrills me. Pay my tab, won't you dear kitty. then I'll tell you anything you want to know."

"I will pay some of it," I said. "Remember, I am not the gallant pirate at the moment, merely a night security guard."

"Oh, how the mighty have fallen," the Czarina said. "Well, you are going to be a Pirate again soon, aren't you."

 "I do not have a confirmed delivery date at the moment.""When I get my ship," I said.

"No word yet on when the space station will be fully restored either," the Czarina said. "We are all limited, Captain Star Runner."

"I am limited as to my knowledge about two individuals," I said, having paid a portion of the Czarina's very substantial tab. She was desperate enough for any contributions I might make that she did not even look to see how much I had paid before letting me get to the point of my visit. "I need information about or the whereabouts of two individuals, Thunder Bone Bobby and Deadly Dudley. Can you help?"

The Czarina did not answer immediately. That in itself was strange. The Czarina talked all the time. Much of what she said was affected nonsense. I suspected it was an act. Like many of the hangers-on on Hypatia, creating a character and staying in character was necessary for survival. The Czarina traded on gossip.

"I know a few things," The Czarina said. "You must tell me why you want to know."

The Czarina never talked like this. What was wrong?

"Have I said something indiscrete?" I asked. "You know my memory is not in tact."

"Not that I'm aware of," The Czarina said.

"All right," I said. "I'm asking because Emily Dickinson thought I should."

This was not all of it. It might be enough.

"You went to the Fends?" the Czarina asked.

"Yes," I said. "We are friends."

"You used to be more, darling."

"We might be again," I said lightly. "One never knows about such things. I might just not replace my memories of Emily  Dickinson if that would interfere with something happening between us again." This was a lie, but the Czarina did not need to know that. I would replace all of my memories when I got my ship. 

"I wouldn't have the courage to let down my guard with an assassin," the Czarina said.

"Emily Dickinson would tell me if he knew I was targeted for assassination," I said. "I have been targeted in the past. I am still here."

"By that awful Phani person," the Czarina said.

"Yes," I said, "and others in other places. But you are not answering my question, Czarina. Is there a problem?"

The Czarina stared at me for a long time. Then she leaned over our small table, lowering her voice to a whisper. "I was married to Deadly Dudley for a time. Most people don't know this. He left me for another woman. That's why I'm marooned here."

"So you are not well-disposed toward Deadly Dudley?" I asked.

"Certainly not," the Czarina said, resuming her royal manner. "But I do keep track of him. He is the reason I said what I did about assassins."

"Deadly Dudley is a paid assassin" I asked.

"No, not really," The Czarina said, "Not like Emily Dickinson. He just likes killing people. There is a difference."

"A very big difference," I said.

"They're not here," The Czarina said. "Dudley has a ship. It wasn't docked near the explosion. He and Bobby left right after the explosion. They haven't been back."

"Will you tell me when hey return?" I asked.

The Czarina did not answer.

"I can make another deposit on your tab,' I said.

The Czarina sighed. "In for a penny, in for a pound,' she said. "You've always been generous with me when you have been flush. These are hard times, Captain Star Runner, hard times."

"Indeed they are," I said. "Will you tell me."

"Yes," the Czarina said.

"Thank you," I said. "Now, I must be going so as not to be late for work."

"Ta-ta," the Czarina said..

As I padded across the great lobby of Shepheard's Hotel, I wondered that the duo of Thunder bone Bobby and Deadly Dudley were out of the system. What were they doing? Christabel's research had sown they were definitely local miscreants. yet they had a ship and business elsewhere. 

"the plot thickens,Christabel," I said.

Chapter Fourteen
I Think Some More

When I returned to the Library of the Mind, I learned Stephen Silk had regained consciousness. He would be moved home at the end of the day tomorrow. Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) told me. I was polite but I did not ingratiate myself to her. There was still no word from Tamara. I still did not know if I could trust her. I doubted it very much. I went to my lair. It had not been disturbed. Emily Dickinson had told me how to leave telltales so I would know. Outside of my door were the parts to make a new base station and my anti-grav belt. I was very pleased about the belt. The drape was a nuisance. I felt very silly wearing it. I had my supper, spent some bio time in my basket, snapped on my new belt and went outside. Not for the first time, I wondered where Thieves' Alley went. I decided to walk a little ways down it, into the warren of alleys behind the Library of the Mind warehouse. The warehouses on either side of the Library of the Mind and behind it and to either side were all empty. The alleys forked and forked again. I set a reminder to map these so that I could use them to get out onto another street. These interior warehouses must have exclusively used rooftop transport or they moved items from one to another to get them to a street.

I returned to the Library of the Mind and, to test my anti-grav belt, decided to go directly to the roof from Thieves' Alley. It was a slow go because I set everything for minimum lift but I got there just fine. My reconnoiter was swift. Nothing ever seemed to be going on in this area at night. Traffic ran steadily past the warehouse during the day. It was a caravan route. However, at night there were few caravan cars passing the warehouse.

All proximity alarms were set. All workable cameras were on. I laid down to think.  

I had information. It was in no particular order. Without my memories, I felt very incapable of ordering the information I had to be useful. I had no new information on my ship. I would be here for the foreseeable future.

Emily Dickinson's offer for me to use his apartment was generous. It also came with a hefty price tag. I would have to pay to have it reopened, reoccupied. Putting the base station inside would cost me something, to break the seal and to have it resealed, but nothing else need be done. If I paid for reactivating the apartment, Emily Dickinson would not have to do when he came out of the Fends. It was to his advantage to have me do it. It was a considerable expense. My funds were limited. My ship was an  upgrade from what I previously had. I had not fully amortized The Three Little Kittens. The insurance money from the tanker helped, but it did not pay the fall replacement cost. Oh yes, there was money enough for me. I had money set aside for such contingencies. However, I was always careful not to spend too much. If I was living in Emily Dickinson's apartment when he came out of the Fends, we would then live together. It was a very small apartment--for one person--and I am a big animal. Friction could come about very quickly. our friendship was long-standing. Our lovemaking had ended badly. Trying to revive it under these circumstances did not seem a wise decision. All my subroutines said so and for once, as Christabel pointed out, I was taking the advice of my subroutines.

That meant I would stay here and continue to be the Library of the Mind's night security guard. I was doing the job right now. So far, it was neither stressful or dangerous. It was, quite frankly, boring. Even he evening light show from the Pyramid Volcano did not capture my attention. It was a part of the evening landscape. Only if I were asked to get involved in the security of the items being shipped to Stephen Silk would any of the Library of the Mind's business dealings concern me. 

That is, and Christabel pointed this out, if Stephen Silk could be trusted.

Were they terrorists? Were they planning something against the Empire? Was that any concern of mine?

I found myself scanning the sky, looking for stars. Although they were stars, the Mother's Tail was not visible. It would not be visible here on Hypatia. I knew that, but I had looked anyway. 

The Mother of Us All is a constellation representing our Mother Pantheran. She watches over each of us, especially those of us who travel among the stars. When I can see one of the stars of her constellation, even if the star configuration looks nothing like Mother Pantheran bounding across the sky to come to my aid, I feel comforted. Looking into Hypatia's night sky, I felt very much alone, confused and very uncertain as to my course of action.

There was an interdiction line from the Pantheran Empire, Coalition Space, it is called, between the Coalition and the Northern Frontier on one side and the Southern Frontier and the Coalition on the other side. The Empire is slowly extending its boundary to the west. Hypatia lies to the east of he Pantheran Empire. The area of space where Terry ships are not challenged is called the Eastern Gate. It is, I have been told, in the Empire's interest for Terries to go in and out via the Eastern Gate and come to worlds like Hypatia. The Empire could close the gate. The Empire could make it very difficult for any Terry to get to Hypatia. But the Empire finds it useful to keep the Eastern Gate open. The Terries bring goods into the Empire through the Eastern Gate, items mined here on Mark Antony and goods procured by the League of Hypatian Pirates. In fact, the Pantheran Empire gets a lot of Terry criminals outside of Coalition space and operating here in the Pharaoh Star System. The Terries know all this and yet they think they are pulling something over on the members of The Race. This is all very odd to me. But then, I am a Star Runner and I do not understand all the angles.

In the past several years, Hypatia has become more of a tourist  destination for very rich Terries and members of other races, too. Live on a world with much volcanic activity. See these volcanoes erupt. Try your skill and courage going outside of the dome or riding the hover train to the Third Cataract. Dive in the North Sea. These are extreme vacations, I am told. A great deal of money changes hands.

So why would someone start a Library here, a Library of the Mind which clearly evokes the University of the Mind on Socrates on the Northern Frontier? Could it be funded by someone here on Hypatia? Would tourists to Hypatia want to come here? Would Hypatia be safeguarding something from Earth or would someone be taking something from Earth the Coalition wanted to stay there and placing it here under the watchful eye of the League of Hypatian Pirates. The League of Hypatian Pirates would not take kindly to the Empire coming to retrieve the item by force.

Then there was the matter of Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby. Where were they and did they have anything to do with the Library of the Mind and its delivery? If not, who was interested in it? If no one was interested in obtaining it, why did Stephen Silk tell me there was a rumor of a theft? And finally, why did Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) lie to me? Did Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) really know Tamara and was she a friend?

I decided that neither Christabel nor I or the two of us working together could resolve any of this. I did not have enough information. I did not remember nearly enough about people, about the Pantheran Empire, about the Terries, about all the intricacies of life here on Hypatia to know what to do. The Fungusians had done their best to give me a working system. They just could not have foreseen my extreme need for all my stored data to be available to me. Their assumption that I would only need all my data when in space had turned out to be a wrong assumption. The data was out of my purview at this time. What should I do?

I needed help. Where could I find help?

Not the Fungusians.
No the Plumies.
Not Emily Dickinson. He had given me all the information he had. Although I would return soon to visit him the point of his banishment to the Fends was isolation. I did not want to violate the terms of his incarceration. That would not go well for either him or me. I had to wait for his help until he was allowed to come out of the Fends. Then I suspected he would want a commission and be busy planning how to assassinate someone. There was always someone on Hypatia who needed to be assassinated.

I worked for the League of Hypatian Pirates. I worked for them but I was not of them. here would be no help there.

Tamara was unavailable. She also was not devious enough. Tamara loved her work as an archeologist. Current affairs did not interest her much.

I needed to contact Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. There might be a chance she would know something about the three Terries at the Library of the Mind. They were all on the Northern Frontier. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo might also be able to help me resolve my dilemma.

Christabel and I composed a message to my old friend who worked for the Alliance in what I think is military intelligence. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo reports to the Minister of Defense. It might take some time to get an answer. I would have to wait for it. I could do nothing until something changed. In the meantime, I could guard the Library of the Mind and see if any ore information came my way. I set up a reminder to visit both Emily Dickinson and the Czarina soon.

Dawn was showing in the east when I came down from the roof and returned to my lair for some much needed sleep. Christabel noted I was very tired and stressed. My AI promised REM sleep and a full regimen of bio adjustments. I looked forward to her soothing routines which would put me to sleep.

Chapter Fifteen
A Wreath on the Door

When I awoke, I had a message waiting for me from the League of Hypatian Pirates Office. I had been listed as a possible hindrance to a scheduled delivery to the Library of the Mind. The delivery would be made by none other than Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby. They were concerned I might threaten their persons or their cargo.

This was a pretty standard notification. I responded with a standard reply, stating that Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby should not be injured by me so long as I myself was in no danger, that the facility of the Library of the Mind would experience no ill affect from their delivery and that the Terries in the building should experience no negative affect of the delivery. Basically, if they made their delivery and the item was safe and they did not bother anybody, I would not bother them.

So, I thought I will finally find out who Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby are. I also now had the name of their ship and their estimated arrival time. One question from last night resolved.

I made ready to leave the Library of the Mind. I thought it was time to go to the upscale commercial area of Ptolemy City. I wanted to visit a coffee shop and interact with some different people. I knew just the place to spend my first night off.

The Valley of the Kings circles a lake in the heart of the upscale area of Ptolemy City. There is a shopping mall in the shape of a sunken pirate ship at one end and a large peer goes out into the water at the other end of the oval-shaped lake. If you are wondering why there is a lake in a domed city the reason is simple. It is for fire protection. Although the Ptolemy City Fire Department has a variety of chemicals to extinguish fires, it prefers to use water. Meantime, the tourists can sail little boats or pay their fare to be taken out onto the water or ride one of the big party ships. I have never done any of these things. There is the matter of very wet water to consider and I do not care to be all that near it much less actually within inches of it. No thank you.

I was on my way to 	the Zocolo Cafe.  It was at Marker Seventeen, locally called Queen Street. Since the Valley of the Kings in compasses the entirety of Lake Memphis, locals have divided its length into sections and called them streets. The builders of the Valley of the Kings put up convenient markers and these define the beginnings and ends of streets and provide additional information to locate favorite establishments.

It had been some time ago that I last visited the Zocolo. Its familiar smells greeted me when I entered. There were tables out on Queen Street, but I preferred to go inside. The wait staff looked unfamiliar. The Fungusians might not have included any of them in my portable database. I would need to have a backup plan more carefully thought out in future. Christabel logged this thought and put it in a follow-up file. She was quite organized. I liked this AI and advised her to be certain to inform the Fungusians as soon as possible to incorporate a version of her in my new AI. I thought it might be high time to update my AI. I had been upgrading but maintaining my original ship's AI personality. I decided I was doing hat for sentimental reasons and I could now move on to something else. I was being too Terry-like. It was a side effect of being around them all the time. They liked to hang onto things.

"Captain Star Runner," a man said, "How nice to see you." He pulled out a chair at a table. "Please sit here and join me."

This man was not an employee. I had misread the situation.

"Who are you?" I asked. "I thought you might be a wait staffer. I have not been here in the Zocolo Cafe for some time."

"No," the man said. "I am no longer a wait staff person here at the Zocolo. I was for a time. Perhaps you remember me from that time."

I did not respond. The man had not answered my question.

"Please identify yourself," I said. I felt uneasy. The surprises kept coming. I did not like it. It was dangerous and I felt, very uncharacteristically, a little scared. What mistakes might I make out of ignorance?

"My name is Ronnie Camberwell," the man said. "Will you order."

I sat. I waited.

"I work for the Ptolemy City police," Ronnie Camberwell said. "I wanted to ask you a few questions."

"Your rank and badge number," I said.

"It's Detective Ronnie Camberwell," the man said. "Here is my badge"

He showed me. It appeared to be legitimate.

"How did you know I was coming here?" I asked.

"I didn't," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I happened to be here when you bounded in. We spoke briefly last spring when you were at the art gallery."

"You were the one who thought I was involved," I said.

"At first," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "However, I quickly revised my opinion. I have followed your career for some time. I find you, interesting."

"Interesting?" I queried. Christabel was turning up nothing about a detective or a policeman. This was very disturbing. I would have to revise my schedule and get out to the Fends quicker than I had imagined. 

"There is no need for concern, Captain Star Runner," Detective Ronnie Camberwell continued, "I do not suspect you of anything."

"Then why do you want to talk to me?" I asked.

"Because I think you could help me," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said simply. "I think you are in a position to provide me with some information."

"Why would I want to do that?" I asked. My carefree afternoon was quickly turning ugly. I enjoyed the Zocolo, but if the Ptolemy City police force thought of the Zocolo Cafe as a convenient place to loathe me, I would have to change my cafe of choice and immediately.

I was under no obligation. I was under the protection of the League of Hypatian Pirates. Although I technically did not belong to the League, a matter of bylaws and of convenience to both the League of Hypatian Pirates and myself, I was associated closely enough that my activities were not within the Ptolemy City's police force's jurisdiction.Put simply, piracy was legal on Hypatia and I was a pirate.

"I know you are under no obligation to assist the Ptolemy City police, Captain Star Runner," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "but it's a local matter and I thought--"

Detective Ronnie Camberwell trailed off. "I'm sorry, Captain Star Runner. You came in here to have something to eat and drink and I have  caught you unawares. I'm sorry for that. I know you are a bit out of your element here in Ptolemy City. I am certain you consider the police force to be meddlesome especially after the incident at the art gallery last spring. (Two people had been brutally murdered. I had found them. I had had some dealings with them. I was not responsible for their deaths, at least, not in any direct way. Although I could not say why, I felt uneasy about their deaths. It was a vague memory, perhaps some part of my mind that had not been well-erased.) I just thought you might be able to tell me something useful about the library."

I often had trouble assessing Terry emotions correctly. However, I thought by his reddish face and hands twisting a napkin that Detective Ronnie Camberwell was embarrassed and uncomfortable with our situation. 

"What about the Library of the Mind?" I asked. This was certainly unexpected. perhaps this Terry would have some information for me.

"Shall we walk?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell said suddenly.

"All right," I said  slowly. We had not ordered anything.

Both Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I got up from the table and walked outside. He started walking down Queen Street alongside lake Memphis. I was forced to get very close to water. Anyone, I thought, who knew me at all would know this was not my choice to walk here. Apparently, Detective Ronnie Camberwell thought this would be less obtrusive than sitting and talking in the Zocolo Cafe.

"Several months ago," Detective Ronnie Camberwell began, "we, that is, the local government here in Ptolemy City, received a request for funding for a library, a library to be for and about Terrans. As you might imagine, we were very surprised as government is not a major player here on Hypatia. We make sure that utilities are available, that the caravan system runs, that the electricity is on, that sort of thing. We have little money and we don't fund libraries. The request was so strange we contacted the Hypatian Board of Directors and the League of Hypatian Pirates to see if they knew anything about these people. There were two names, Stephen Silk and Gail Jeffrey. No one had ever heard of them. They said they were from the Northern Frontier, specifically, that they had ties to the University of the Mind on Socrates. Are you familiar with Socrates or the University?"

"Yes," I said. "I've been there."

"Okay, so you know it is a major institution in the Alliance. We contacted the Alliance and they confirmed that both of them had been connected with the University of the Mind but they had been terminated. They had been teachers of Terran history, but they were politically undesirable."

"Hmm," I thought. "So Emily Dickinson's wild theorizing could be correct, that these were revolutionaries of some kind."

"Well, as you know, such matters are beyond our jurisdiction. We were set up as I said to keep Ptolemy City running and to police the staffers so that the tourists are not inconvenienced. We simply responded that although we would be open to their coming to Hypatia, we were not in a position to either fund or regulate their library.

"Several weeks ago, three persons arrive, Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey and a woman named Zora O'Neill Eisenhower. We knew nothing of her so we made more inquiries. She is known to the League of Hypatian Pirates."

This surprised me. The League had not told me that when I had inquired. But then, as Christabel pointed out, I had not asked them if they knew her. The League could be very closed mouth and only answer the direct question the petitioner had asked. I would have to confirm whatever Detective Ronnie Camberwell told me.

"The League stated that she was a known thief on the Northern Frontier.They knew of no relationship that she had with either Gail Jeffrey or Stephen Silk.

"We have also heard rumors that a major shipment is coming to the library. We have also heard rumors that a robbery is planned."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell stopped speaking. I knew this meant he wanted me to comment. What should I say? I had little time to decide. I could simply say this was none of my business and leave him. I could tell him I knew. I could tell him part of what I knew and then decide to tell him what I did not know but suspected. Instead, I asked Detective Ronnie Camberwell a question,

"Who is rumored to conduct the theft?"

"Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

Hmm again. "Are they still off  planet?" I asked.

"Yes."

"Do you know where they went?" I asked.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "You know of course no one needs to file a flight plan out of the Pharaoh Star System."

"Yes, of course I do," I said. "Do you know for whom they are working?"

"No clue," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. 

"do you think they are working on their own?" I asked.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "You seem to have thought about this, Captain Star Runner. What do you know?"

"That Stephen Silk knows about the rumors," I said, "and that Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) says she does not."

"Zoe?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Yes," I said. 'They call her Zoe."

"I've heard of Zoe O'Neill," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "Have you?"

"Not that I am aware of," I said truthfully. "Explain."

"Zoe O'Neill is a jewel thief on the Southern Frontier," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "She is wanted on no less than five planets."

"Has she ever been to the Northern Frontier?" I asked.

"Not that law enforcement knows about," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"That is quite strange," I said. "Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) told me she was friends with someone I know quite well who went to the University of the Mind. I cannot get in touch with my friend. She is an archeologist and is on something she calls a dig."

"So she knows who you are," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"Yes," I said. "And she told me how she knew me. I responded to a listing on the public board for the job of night security guard at the Library of the Mind. I did that at the Czarina's suggestion."

"And she was married to Deadly Dudley," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"So she says," I said. "However, I found the listing myself. Of course, she could have known it was one of the few listings that I might take, but to involve her in this investigation seems far-fetched to me."

"I will simply chat with the Czarina," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"pay part of her tab," I said. "The Czarina will talk in direct proportion to the money you put on it. You will not be able to pay the whole tab. It is quite extensive."

"Thank you for the tip," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"There is a fire at the Library of the Mind," I said to Detective Ronnie Camberwell as soon as Christabel alerted me to the alarm. "Call the fire department. It is quite small. It does not threaten the building if it is put out quickly. It is in the basement, near my lair. I think it is directed at me."

Setting a fire on Hypatia is a capital offense.

I was pleased I had been with Detective Ronnie Camberwell at the time the blaze was identified and that it had been my AI who had detected it immediately. Why in the world would I start a fire outside my lair which would affect my AI anyway?

The fire department had no doubt the fire was arson. They had a team on it. After checking in with the fire officials, Detective Ronnie Camberwell was free to go. After speaking with the fire officials concerning Christabel, I packed up my base secondary base station. My request to have Emily Dickinson's apartment unsealed was granted immediately. Arrangements were underway for my lair to be relocated to Emily Dickinson's apartment as soon as possible. No one thought it advisable for me to say at the Library of the Mind while the arson investigation proceeded.

Of course,that presented a problem for my employer.

"Who will look after the Library is you are not here?" Stephen Silk asked. Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I were sitting in the Silk-Jeffrey's living quarters. 

"I am off duty at the moment," I said. "That is in our contract. You will have to monitor the building yourself."

"I can't do that."

I remained silent. It was not my responsibility. In fact, Christabel was running a subroutine right now to see if I should give notice.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "I am sure Captain Star Runner will report for duty at the designated time. In the meantime, I believe you have a security system in place here you can monitor."

"It is incomplete," Stephen silk said.

"Then I suggest you upgrade it," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "It will be at your own expense, of course, but I would recommend it. Ptolemy City is for all intents a lawless town. You were fortunate Captain Star Runner was alerted by its AI that it was threatened by fire. Otherwise, your losses could have been severe."

"Can you monitor the central computer remotely from your new location?" Stephen Silk asked me.

"It is possible," I said. "Can we come to a contractual arrangement for me to do that?"

Stephen Silk named a figure. Christabel ran a routine.

"Half again," I said "and I can monitor your systems around the clock and make visual inspections as previously arranged."

It may not tell us who set it though I suspect Zoe O'Neill."

"Zoe O'Neill perhaps in league with outside elements or perhaps in league with Gail Jeffrey," I said. "I don't believe Stephen Silk is involved. My sense of him, and I am often not a good judge of Terry character, is that he was honestly upset by the fire and worried about the library."

"Yes, that was my impression also," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "But you are right about the women. Neither one of them was there. If Zoe O'Neill set the fire, she may be using Gail Jeffrey as her alibi. Or, they might be in it together, or Gail Jeffrey is using Zoe O'Neill as her alibi or it just was lucky for them that they weren't present. We just don't know at this time."

When we arrived at Emily Dickinson's apartment, it was unsealed. The professional robotic company used to make the apartment habitable again was just finishing up. They were incredibly prompt. 

"There is no food," the supervising robot told me.

"That is all right," I said. "I do not require any to be available."

The robots set up my secondly base ?" he suggested. I believe they have lockers with an energy supply."

"Do they?" I asked.

I had been through the spaceport. Everyone here had. My own ship could not land at the spaceport so I had been strictly a paying passenger.

"I'll check."

A moment later Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "Yes. They would be happy to oblige you. I've let the fire department know they should move it there when they're finished with their investigation. They'll text you so you can oversee the process."

"Thank you," I said. "That is very kind of you."

"You were very helpful alerting us to the fire and keeping me up-to-date about the Library of the Mind. As you can see, this fire changes everything."

"How so" I asked.

"I need to eat and you never got your coffee at Zocolo Cafe," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "Shall we remedy both contingencies?"

I was beginning to like this Terry.

"Yes," I said. "That sounds like a good idea."

detective Ronnie Camberwell seemed to know where he was going so I followed him. Although Emily Dickinson lives in this neighborhood, he is seen publicly at Shepheard's Hotel. it is part of his image as a professional assassin and standup comic. It may sound like an odd combination but it works for him.

The street was crowded. It was fully dark. There were quaint street lights rather than general low-level illumination. If I went up on any of the roofs here I would be able to see the stars. Ptolemy City residents really wanted their connection to the stars. 

Casinos and other businesses wanted the tourist crowd to lose track of time. The every residents wanted to know their time here was in some way temporary, that the universe beckoned them. Many people lived their whole diner! Detective Ronnie Camberwell took me to a diner. I love diners. I did not know they existed in Ptolemy City. How strange I did not know this. I worked this part of the galaxy and did not know about this diner.

The Galactic Diner. What was it doing here on the Lower Nile as if it was the crossroads of the Milky Way?

I read the menu with interest. It named all of its dishes with a galactic reference--stars, suns, planets, constellations. I was having so much fun I almost forgot to order anything. I ordered macaroni and cheese, of course. They called it Sagittarius Bows. I asked the wait robot why. It explained that Sagittarius was a constellation seen from Earth. It was an archer and his bow. I did not know what an archer and a bow was. Detective Ronnie Camberwell explained it was a person and a weapon. She drew me a quick sketch. Christabel looked up the reference.

Regardless of its imaginative name, the macaroni and cheese was excellent and so were the chocolate chip cookies I ate for dessert--two large ones. Detective Ronnie Camberwell ate something she called a salad. It looked like leaves. I wondered at this. But then I have learned that my female friends are worried about their appearance much of the time. As a result, their eating habits are unpredictable.

"You aren't wearing a scarf," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I often saw you walking across the lobby of Shepheard's Hotel wearing a scarf. You always looked so grand."

I considered this. What did looking grand mean. It was positive. I thought it might mean more than positive but I could not be certain with my limited database.

"My scarves were lost in the explosion," I said. "I have not had a reason to replace them yet."

"Would you like to--I know a place--" Detective Ronnie Camberwell stopped in mid sentence. her face turned that red color even under her brown skin.

"You find me attractive wearing a scarf," I ventured.

"Yes," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"You wish to have a more personal contact with me," I said.

"Yes," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

She emphasized the "Y" in each answer.

I paused.

"Is this wise?" I asked. "You have an investigation and I am part of such an investigation. You have a word for this, something about judgment?"

"Yes," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said again, "and conflict of interest."

"I inherently have a conflict of interest with you," I said. "My objectives in this so called case of yours may be very different."

"So you aren't interested," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said and looked quite crestfallen.

"I would like to walk along the street," I said. "That is what I think I would like now that I have eaten all this food."

Christabel was already preparing subroutines to restore my system. She was making a clucking sound which was her way of expressing disapproval. My Terry food indulgences are well-known. 

I believe the word for what we did I asked as we turned off Lower Nile Street in the direction of Emily Dickinson's apartment. "You want me to monitor the Library of the Mind. What am I looking for? Can you provide me with any more information?"

Detective Ronnie Camberwell stopped short.

"OH," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "you're talking about the case."

"What else would I be talking about?" I asked.

"Oh, I don't know," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said in a dispirited way. "I thought maybe you were talking about soothing else? But to answer your question," her voice took on a matter-of-fact tone, "I want you to look in the central computer for any new information posted there or anything in the warehouse's previous history that is at all suggestive. I know that is pretty general, but I don't know what specific thing to tell you to look for. I'm hoping you'll know it when you see it."

This Terry-speak is often very confusing. Christabel and I decoded it. Christabel's interpersonal subroutine explained that Detective Ronnie Camberwell had been originally thinking about a relationship between her and me while I was thinking abut the library. That explained that part. As for what she had just said, I was to investigate inside the computer to learn whatever I could.

"Very well," I said. "I will do that. Actually, my AI will do that. I will sleep right now. It has been a very busy day and although I usually am awake all night, I am very tired. I will text you when I have something."

"I will do the same," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

I left her at the corner of Emily Dickinson's alleyway. The buildings are close together here. The alleyways are numerous. I threaded my way up several levels until I came to her door and unlocked it with my personal password.

"Lights," I said as I entered the room.

they came on promptly. Electricity had been restored. The temperature was warm--the way I liked it. It was extremely pleasant to be out of the library basement. The warehouse never felt warm to me.

I made a quick tour of the space, just to make sure all was well and curled up happily in my basket. Christabel set about putting my biological system to rights. I drifted off to sleep.

Chapter Fifteen
I Receive Some News
While I slept, several messages arrived.

Chapter Sixteen
I Receive Two Important Messages

Wonderful! I Christabel gave me the wonderful news. I had two messages, one from Tamara and one from Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. I quivered all over with excitement. They were full videos, too, so I could hear and see them as they responded to me.

Still twitching with excitement, I opened Tamara's message.

Tamara was sitting inside a rather drab room. I was certain this was one of the pre-fabricated buildings her archeological mission set up on a planet. Tamara looked straight into the recorder.

"Hi Star, I'm sorry it is taking me so long to answer your message. You knew I was out on a dig. So far, we're just digging. We haven't found anything really significant yet. Though I can tell you that Pantherans have been here in the past. We're dating contact now. This is not surprising. Evidence that your ancestors traveled through this part of the galaxy a long time ago has been well-documented. What we still don't know for certain is why they were here and why they didn't stick around. I don't know if you care about this. It's just--we really want to learn about your ancestors before the imperial stage.

"But you didn't text me to learn how we were doing on the dig. It was nice of you to remember to ask.

Remember. You must be really struggling with the Three Little Kittens destroyed. I'm so sorry. I know how proud you were of that ship and all the improvements you made. I'm so relieved to hear you weren't hurt in the explosion. How is your new AI working out and is the base station serving your needs? Where are you living and what are you doing to keep yourself occupied? I hope you are not spending all your time in Terran restaurants. You know our food in large quantities isn't good for you. I feel sort of responsible for your liking it so well. I was the one who introduced you to all of it back on Pirate's Cove in the Spyglass Cafe. Wow. That seems so long ago. I was just a kid wondering if I'd ever do anything else in my life except wait on tables.

Well, to get to the point, I did know someone back at the University of the Mind named Zora Eisenhower. O'Neill does not sound right. I met her my first year there. She was part of my orientation cluster, a sort of support group to get us all used to being away from home and on Socrates. We shared part of our history so I shared a little about you because you were my guardian. I told a little about my parents, too, but since they were dead it didn't seem as important. They all thought it was both exciting and strange that you were responsible for me and that you were funny and nice. Zora was pretty troubled. She got into a bad crowd. The University of the Mind is a pretty big place, Star, so it's easy to lose track of people. I'm not even sure if Zora stayed in school. I didn't have any classes with her. Since I'm not on Socrates, I can't send you a picture of her.

"I'm sorry I can't tell you anything else. It seems strange you would run into her on Hypatia. Zora was interested in being a school teacher, I thought, teaching children, juveniles, you know. I don't think she'd be involved with cataloging acquisitions in a start-up library.

"Hope you're okay. Do send me a message and tell me how you're getting along. I'm sorry I haven't been of more help to you.

"We'll have to get together when I get back to Socrates and you get your new ship. I'll want a ride. You know I always love sailing with you, Star.

Love you. Bye."

The message ended.

Tamara knew someone named Zora Eisenhower. Detective Ronnie Camberwell had said   the person at the Library of the Mind was named Zoe O'Neill but she had told me her name was Zora O'Neill Eisenhower but people called her Zoe. This intelligence was worth passing along to Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Either Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) was both Zora Eisenhower and Zoe O'Neill or there were two women and they had some connection. Somehow, Zoe O'Neill at the Library of the Mind had correct information about me and Tamara. 

This worried me. I still am very protective of Tamara. I do not want anything untoward happening to Tamara. I think of her as basically naive. This may not be true. I think Tamara thinks the same of me. Either way, we both look out for each other. Tamara taught me about friendship. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo once observed that Tamara was more than a friend to me. Tamara was family. Since I am uncertain was this means--not in a biological sense but in a relationship sense--I do not know what to think about this.

I instructed Christabel to keep building the data tree with all of its possible permutations. Then I opened Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo's message.

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was also sitting in her office looking straight into the recorder. She was in uniform--her dress uniform. She looked very official. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo also spoke in a very crisp voice. She meant business.

"Captain Star Runner, how good of you to be in touch with me and this office concerning your findings at the Library of the Mind, Ptolemy City, Hypatia, Pharaoh Star System beyond the Eastern Gate of the Coalition."

This was an official communication. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was not sending me a usual message, but was speaking for the Ministry of Defense at the Alliance. This communication would be logged. What did this mean?

"Your intelligence concerning Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey's and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe), Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby, as you have named these individuals, and the construction of the Library of the Mind, greatly interests this office. I will be leaving from Grand Central Station shortly to meet you at your earliest convenience on Hypatia. 

"I look forward to seeing you shortly. I will be coming via high-speed packet and I hope to be at your location within the next four days.

"Cheers. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo ..."

The good captain gave all her rank and office identification.

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was coming here and soon. What did this mean?

Christabel said, "Fast packets are used for important data, persons or items, such as repair parts. This must be a very important person or the situation is very critical to the Alliance, especially to either its defense or it wants to protect persons, items or information."

Christabel was not speaking from my database but from her own.

"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo is an old friend of mine," I said. "We have even worked together on some very important missions for the Alliance."

"That is true," Christabel said, "but the Alliance, especially the Ministry of Defense, is not above using you for its own ends, trading on your friend with Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo."

"They have also gotten me out of some scrapes," I said. "I am foggy on the details right now, but I do know this has happened."

"Yes, that is what the record shows," Christabel said. "Our information is incomplete."

Christabel and I were of one mind that my first order of business, now that I had reviewed my two messages, was to set up the backup base station in a secure location. To that end, I went out of Emily Dickinson's apartment and trotted to Lower Nile Street to catch a Caravan car bound for the spaceport. This area of the dome, though it was only tangentially connected to Ptolemy City, was called the Levant. The Hypatian Pirates had always called their spaceport Tripoli and so it continues to be called by that name by the locals. 

I rode alone in my caravan car and exited at the entrance to the visitors area. I went inside the terminal building, uncertain where to go to find what I needed. I needed cargo, freight, something like that. I was not catching a shuttle to Alexandria Space Station nor did I want a flight over the exotic, beautiful and very dangerous landscape of Hypatia itself. 

A passing robot gave me the information I needed. I prefer asking these machines questions. They usually have enough data to respond to direct questions. I found the corridor that would take me to a freight agent.

The person who helped me turned out to be an eager young man whose name tag read: Red Calp. His head was not a true red, more of a copper-color, but I understand this passes for red among Terries. 

"Sure thing, Captain. We can set you up with a secure locker with a power source for your computer. Do you have it with you?"

"No," I said. It is a bit more extensive than I can carry."

"Well, get it shipped over here and you can set it up yourself or we can have one of our computer robots put it together for you. there's an extra charge, of course."

"Of course," I said. Red Calp showed me the locker. It was properly ventilated, quite secure. It would do very nicely. I took the added precaution of a numbered account rather than publicly displaying my name on he locker.

"A wise precaution," Red Calp said. "You can't be too careful these days."

I used my paw print to secure the account. I had to be alive for the print to be acknowledged. I thought this would be quite helpful. I was very pleased the locker, although not bomb proof--there is no such thing--could withstand a significant blast as well as heat or water damage. It could also withstand an extreme quake.

I returned to Emily Dickinson's apartment and arranged for the transport of the new base station and for it to be assembled and secured by the spaceport robots. My instructions were deleted when the job was complete. I saw to the erasure of their memory. Christabel ran tests. The fire department at the Library of the Mind were finished with their forensic investigation and had released my computer. It was in good working condition and would keep itself up-to-date while verifying that the data sent from my new base station was error and virus free. The Fungusians algorithms were the best in the known galaxy and were updated frequently through the same known galaxy.

This done, I sent a message to Detective Ronnie Camberwell, inviting her to share dinner with me and headed out to the Fends.

Chapter Seventeen
Emily Dickinson and I Talk

"So, pussy cat, you've been a busy little kitten, haven't you?" Emily Dickinson said when I finished telling him all that had happened.

"things seem quite complicated," I said. "I really do not know who all he players are, I mean, I do not know their true identities and I do not know why Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo is coming here."

"Gyllie, she just might want to get out-of-town, pussy cat. The old girl might just want to stretch her legs, if you know what I mean. How do you know she doesn't have a hankering to see me again?"

I considered this. 

"Are you two sexually involved?" I asked.

Emily Dickinson laughed. "Oh, that was a long time ago, pussy cat, like you and me. It was great while it lasted. Besides, I'm sure she'd rather be with you."

I did not say anything. My relationship with captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was, like many tings in my life, complicated. My notes were too sketchy. We wanted to be together; however, her job and my business were incompatible as well as the distances and times we could be together precluded something steady. We were intimate when we were together. We were also intimate with other individuals, at least, I thought Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was. I was. I was thinking I might see what developed with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. At least I was here in Ptolemy City now and I came and went from the Alexandria Space Station when I had a ship.

I suddenly felt very sad. Tamara was so far away. captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo would come and then leave again. My ship was gone.

"Pussy cat, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said, patting my shoulder, you look like you are going to cry. I've never seen you look like this. What's wrong?"

I tried to speak. The words would not come out. Tears trickled down my face. It was very undignified. I was not a juvenile. I sat there, letting Emily Dickinson stroke my flank.

"I feel," I said, "very sad."

"I see that, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said. "Is it about your ship?"

"Yes," I said, "and about Tamara and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and you and not knowing so many things. I feel very confused much of the time. I do not like it."

"You are often confused, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said, scratching me behind the ears. "The difference is, now you are aware of it."

It was a little joke. Emily Dickinson always thought I jumped; to conclusions. Maybe I do. it is hard figuring Terries out. They are very confusing creatures. They are very disorganized in their thinking and their acting.

Emily Dickinson was trying to make me feel better. I liked that.

'thank you, Emily Dickinson," I said. "I know I made you very angry. I am lad we can be friends again."

"You've looked out for me, pussy cat, even when I was really sore at you," Emily Dickinson said. "You're here now and I know you don't like being this near to water. I know King Richard scares you a little."

"He does, though he was very helpful when the corrections people came by," I said. "Do I have to leave soon. Will they come again?"

"They're not in range at the moment," Emily Dickinson said. "King Richard keeps a really good eye out for them. I don't know his story. He's a real part of this place as far as I can find out. You can't really talk to him. He says things and you have to do a lot of guessing."

"I am going to dinner with Detective Ronnie Camberwell," I said. "Tamara reminded me not to overindulge on Terry food."

"Veronica Ione Camberwell," Emily Dickinson said. "She's good-looking, pussy cat, I'll give you that."

"Is she"
 I asked.

"She's tall, long legs. She walks like a man. You wouldn't notice that. Se's got blonde hair and the greenest eyes I've ever seen on a human being."

"You like her?" I asked.

"Me? I like women, pussy cat."

"And me," I said.

"And you," Emily Dickinson agreed.

"What do you mean, Detective Ronnie Camberwell walks like a man?" I asked.

"She's big, rangy, strong. Think about the way she walks and the way Gyllie walks. They're different, aren't they?"

I thought about this. 

"Yes," I said. "I like the way each of them walks."

"Then go for her," Emily Dickinson said. "I'm guessing she's been wondering what you'd be like. Do you have your programs?"

"No," I said, "but Christabel does some different things which are very nice. It will be fine."

"Ask Gyllie to see what she can do about springing me out of here," Emily Dickinson said. "And Star, thanks for coming."

I said, "Does anything I have told you make any sense?"

"Not yet," Emily Dickinson said, "but help is on its way. Stay out of trouble, pussy cat. We have a saying, you know, curiosity killed the cat."

"I have heard that one," I said, "I have also heard cats have nine lives."

"I think you're on your tenth or eleventh. I'm serious about this, pussy cat. Be careful. I think there are some very nasty players in this game. Gyllie wouldn't be coming here otherwise, seriously."

"I will be careful," I said. "It is one of the reasons I thought I should spend some time with Detective Ronnie Camberwell."

"I think she is clean," Emily Dickinson said.

"Of course she is clean," I said.

"No, pussy cat, I mean, I don't think she is corrupt."
"Oh," I said. "do you think she would work for the other side?"

"It happens, pussy cat. It happens."

I thought about this as I crossed King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road's island. What did they call it? A crooked cop.

Without warning, King Richard I stood in front of me.

"Space traveler," King Richard I said. "Beware. I, King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, watch and listen. You will be  in danger soon. Call for assistance. My kingdom is at your disposal."

Then King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, turned aside to let me pass.

His prognostication troubled me greatly. I was scared of him. He did not seem to act rationally and therefore I did not know how to anticipate his actions or interpret them. I believed his warning. I believed I was in danger. But what that danger was I did not know. Nor did I know how I could or should put his kingdom, whatever he meant by that, at my disposal. And how would I summon his help anyway?

All of these questions were turning around in my mind when I entered the Galactic Diner and looked for Detective Ronnie Camberwell.

Chapter Eighteen
Detective Ronnie Camberwell

"Can I ask you a personal question?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked after we had ordered our dinner. Christabel had insisted on selecting my dinner items. So long as I could choose some dessert, I was happy to eat what she prescribed.

"Yes," I said. "I may not answer you."

"What are you doing in the Pharaoh Star System?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "Aren't you supposed to be in the Coalition?"

"Not at all," I said. "I started out there. I was engineered at the Institute and grew up there. I studied and trained to be a star runner. After my training was completed, I was declared surplus."

Explaining this used to bother me a great deal. I was ashamed of being declared surplus. However, I finally understood it was my abilities and independent spirit that caused me to be placed on the surplus list, not my performance.

"Being declared surplus means you can't get a regular job. Sometimes it means you are incompetent. Sometimes it means there are too many androgens with the same qualifications. Sometimes, as in my case, it means you are not pliable enough. So instead of being terminated, which means to be put to death pleasantly, or to try to find some menial work, I left Pantheran space and went to the Plumies."

'Why did you go there?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "They're whole space is poisonous."

"Not poisonous," I said, "incompatible with Terry and Pantheran life forms. There is a difference.

"I had stolen a ship and got it across the border. They were intrigued and decided to help me. They had a habitat for Terry traders. The Terries do the trading with the Plumies. They put me up there while they fashioned a lair for me so I could pilot one of their ships. I learned how very quickly and I really liked their propulsion system. It's very uncomplicated, unlike Pantheran and Terry technology which is quite similar. I worked for them for a good while. They always protected my identity. Basically, I disappeared.

"I" finally had enough money to go out on my own. They built me a simple ship and I went to the Northern Frontier. I ran guns and other supplies for a good while. Then I got involved with FRONT--Frontier Residents of the Northern Territories. We stole a Pantheran ship. 

"That's when I got blacklisted. I'm sure the Race knew I was operating on the frontier. They could overlook that, let me go about my business. Surplus androgens are allowed to do that. But when I stole one of their warships and worked with the Fungusians to break their military codes, well, that was too much. I had a price on my head as the Terries say.

"Even that was okay until I had to go back into Coalition space for a job--an important job--and got caught."

"What happened. You're not dead."

"No, not physically dead," I said. "I caught some very bad people that were causing the Coalition a great deal of money. My friends brokered a deal. The Race considered me dead. I was banished from the Coalition. If I ever am found within its borders, I will be physically dead. So I operate outside of the Coalition."

"And why Hypatia?"

"Because my friends the Fungusians thought I would be wise to be very far away from the Coalition for some time. They felt the frontiers were too close to Coalition space. They thought the Race might find an excuse to assassinate me if I was too close to. The frontiers are still a part of the Coalition at some level. The warships can and do enter their space.

"I offered my services to the League of Hypatian Pirates and they accepted."

"But you're not a League member."

"No. There are rules about being a Terry. I think they come from a time when the Race infiltrated a lot of organizations and the League of Hypatian Pirates distrusted them. I think sometimes they distrust me because I am a member of The Race. They do not exactly think I am a spy. It is more they are just uneasy around me. Many Terries are."

'And now you are waiting for a new ship," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"That is correct," I said. "Why not tell me about yourself. I do not know anything about you. It is really like meeting you for the first time. It is a limitation of not having my full database available at this time."

"My name is Veronica Ione Camberwell. I am the daughter of police chief. I was born here in Ptolemy City. I've lived here all my life. I've only been as far as mark Antony. I've never been out of the Pharaoh Star System. My mom taught me about policing. I have two sisters that work in the hotels. There isn't much else to tell."

"You are quite strong," I said.

"Yes, that is true. I am what some old timers call a classic dike."

"You prefer women, then?" I asked.

"Yes. I think that is why I am so attracted to you. You looked so feminine in those long scarves and you move with such grace and agility. There are very few Terrans who can move as fluidly as you can."

I had never been complimented like this before. I am large, even for an androgen. To be described as graceful and feminine pleased me. Emily Dickinson never called me that at least, Christabel had no record of it. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo preferred words like magnificent and muscled, strong. Masculine words, I suppose, in a general sort of way. Gender confuses me. 

"Does attraction mean you want to--" I searched for a tactful word

"hook up,," Detective Ronnie Camberwell supplied.

I turned this old-fashioned word over in my mind. Christabel had an ancient definition, which I thought was accurate.

"Yes," I said. "I would like that very much--after I have my chocolate chip cookie."

"You like your Terran food."

"I do," I said, "but my AI cautions me not to eat too much."

We left the Galactic Diner. his was a social encounter. I had not shared with the detective my news.

Chapter Nineteen
I Return to the Library of the Mind

Detective Ronnie Camberwell had big hands and I liked them on my body. She had long legs and I liked the way she wrapped them around me. She had large nipples and she liked the way I licked them. That is how our lovemaking began. Detective Ronnie Camberwell seemed to like what I did and Christabel knew how to synthesize all the right chemicals and touch my brain in all the right places. I chose a female gender to be consistent with Detective Ronnie Camberwell's orientation. It worked very well.

In the morning each of us went to our respective job sites. I did share with her what I had learned. She promised to do research into the Zora Eisenhower and Zoe O'Neill connection. I was less forthcoming about Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo visit. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and I would have to decide, yet again, how we would be managing our relationship on this assignment.

Chapter Twenty
A Conversation with Stephen Silk

I returned to the Library of the Mind. A Christmas wreath hung on the door. I identified as a Christmas wreath because it was green and had a large red bow on it. I had a picture of one in my database. I also had notes abut Christmas and the Night of Singing. I enjoy participate in the Night of Singing. I like singing Christmas carols though Tamara and my other friends tell me they do not enjoy my singing. They say I sound like a cat fight. I am not a cat and I am not fighting.

I opened the door to find Stephen Silk sitting at the receptionist desk.

"Hello," I said. "I am glad to see you are well enough to be out of bed."

"Not really," Stephen Silk said. "I just couldn't stand it any longer. I thought I would just sit here for a little while and get out of our quarters."

"Has everything been quiet here?" I asked. "There have been no alarms or unusual behavior."

"Nothing," Stephen Silk said.

Stephen Silk sighed.

"Something odd is going on," He said. "I don't know what it is."

"You mentioned a rumor," I said. "I can't find out anything else about that," I said."

"Have you inquired?" Stephen Silk looked surprised.

"Yes, of curse," I said. "It would be a security threat and possibly a physical threat. Has your package arrived?"

"That's the thing," Stephen Silk said. "I was notified it was coming and given a date. The date has passed. When I queried my shipping info, I was told there never was a package?"

"Do you want me to follow up?" I asked. "Is this through a normal shipping channel?"

'Through Packages promptly," Stephen Silk said.

"Packages Promptly is a reputable firm," I said. "Hypatia is not a usual destination for them, but I am certain they could have sent your package on through another carrier."

"I don't know much about these things," Stephen Silk said. "I would certainly appreciate it if you could find anything out."

"Is the shipment invoice in the computer?" I asked.

"Yes," Stephen Silk said. "I set up an account--for the library."

He gave me the access code.It would have been simple enough to hack into it.

"I will check it out," I said.

"Captain Star Runner," Stephen Silk said, "I'm sorry about the fire. Did you lose anything?"

"No," I said. I was alerted to the fire in time for the fire department to come and put it out before there was any damage. I am staying off site so that I am not a target for such an event in the future. I have not received any updates from the fire department or police department. Have you?"

"No," Stephen Silk said. "I gather these organizations aren't very effective on Hypatia."

'The fire department is very effective," I said. "The police department is useful in some circumstances but not in others. Where would you like me to work right now?"

"Oh, in the conference room, I suppose," Stephen Silk said vaguely. He looked very tired.

Human health not being something I knew anything about and not wanting to prolong my interview with Stephen Silk, I retired to the conference room which was, thankfully, empty.

The interface was awkward. I did not want to advertise that I was already inside the central computer. It occurred to me this would be an excellent opportunity to do the kind of snooping Detective Roni Camberwell had suggested I do to get more information about the Library of the Mind, the warehouse and the three Terries.

I checked on Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) first. She had access but she had not accessed the computer for several days. previously, her activity showed she was creating some sort of database for the library. Maybe that was the catalog. Her activity was so minimal I decided she must have her own system. I wondered how I could check without asking her. I sent Detective Roni Camberwell  message about this.

I then went to Gail Jeffrey's account. It had even less activity. She ad simply signed in the first time, reset her password and exited.

I texted Detective Roni Camberwell again.

Then I went to Stephen Silk's account. Its activity matched his presence at the Library of the Mind and his recent hospitalization. There were lots of messages to and from Socrates on a variety of topics relating to library chatter. I skimmed this, letting Christabel develop summaries and cross references. I found the order from packages Promptly. It was at Stephen Silk had said. First there was an order, then there was not.
 The order had not said.

packages Promptly supplied me with that information promptly as well.

It was the history department at the University of the Mind.

This is where Stephen Silk had taught.

I addressed a general query to the department, inquiring about any information or packages that had been directed to Hypatia for Stephen silk. It was sent as a computer-generated query so that the history department mail program would treat it as such and respond without notifying anyone. It would take some time for an answer to be returned. Such messages were not high priority.

Then I set about looking into the central computer at the warehouse.

Chapter Twenty-One
Inside the Central Computer

No one knows for sure who established the first dome on Hypatia. There is more than one. most people only know about Ptolemy City. It is not clear who figured out how to create a stable enough foundation to support a domed environment. It is unlikely this was a Terran invention. Some have thought it is a Pantheran invention. I, of course, like this idea. What works against this position is that the Pantheran Empire has never extended in this direction. There are no domes engineered like this in other parts of the Empire either. This suggests a third group. The Plumies have been suggested, but their engineering style is different. The Plumies I have talked to about this think it may have been an off-shoot of their race no longer extent. I have asked the Fungusians if they know who built the first dome on Hypatia. I think they do know but the Fungusians often choose not to share what they know. They are mysterious that way. it also means people cannot accuse them of spreading rumors or sharing unpopular ideas.

What is know is that he League of Hypatian Pirates found this dome in tact and set up their operations here and at the Third Cataract. THE WAREHOUSES ARE OLD> THIS COMPUTER WAS CERTAINLY QUITE OLD> Christabel AND I worked slowly to get into the different databases.

I learned this warehouse had been used to store parts for spaceships. The parts were manufactured elsewhere and stored here, then shipped out to Over the Moon spaceport on Cleopatra. I wondered why the warehouses had not built there, but Christabel suggested that the dome already being built, it was more economical to store the parts here and move them to the big spaceport as needed. From my incomplete memory of over the Moon, it was primarily for the large ships. The interplanetary shuttles then brought the supplies here that could not be accommodated there. Was Over the Moon also built by the same race that built Ptolemy City dome? Christabel did not have an answer for this. The historical record gave me nothing. but it seemed likely. Also, it was possible the same interplanetary shuttles brought came from Mark Antony here and make a circuit.

I did not know what half the equipment stored here was. My ships are made by Plumies. While I was a part of the Empire's military, I never dealt with ship parts. I was only concerned with piloting the ship and the state of its AI. There were other androgens to maintain the spacecraft.

Next I turned to the financial records. I depended heavily on Christabel here. I have always bought good programs for my AI to use to maintain my own financial records and bought the AI software to help me make good financial decisions. For the most part, this has been a successful strategy. Christabel said that the records were extensive and that the firm had operated for over fifty years and was profitable. The owner had relocated the business to the Alexandria space station when it was built. I suspected it was sold to another concern later. The space station had been in operation for nearly seventy-five years and I had no notion of such a firm operating there by this name.

Buried deep within the computer was a whole section of manuals. It explained how the deliveries were made and how pars were shipped out. There were diagrams for the mechanical I had seen in the warehouse. Of more interest to me was the information on the hatch in the dome. It was an airlock. That made sense. It also explains how a vessel could activate the hatch from either the inside or the outside and how the correct pressures were applied. I made sure Christabel copied the opening and closing signals so that any ship I might be associated with could operate the hatch. There was no way of knowing if the hatches could still be opened. I texted Detective Roni Camberwell to ask about this and for Christabel to search any public databases. It would be good to know if the information I had was still current.

Finally, there was information on employees and technical information on the building itself. Nothing seemed overly helpful though I had Christabel inventory the internal specifications for everything. This took some time.

Still no response from Detective Roni Camberwell. Still no response from Packages Promptly. No word from Stephen Silk or Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo.

Christabel reminded me I needed refreshment. I left the Library of the Mind and went back to Emily Dickinson's apartment. I wondered if any of my research had been worth my time. Christabel pointed out that the hatch information could prove useful in future.

Chapter Twenty-Two
I Learn More About People of Interest

I was sitting on the rooftop, thinking night security guard work was very dull and boring, when a camel caravan stopped below me and Detective Roni Camberwell stepped out.

"Hello," I called down from the roof.

"Captain Star Runner, is that you?" Detective Roni Camberwell called back.

"Yes," I said. "I will come down."

With my anti-grav belt, it was easy to reach ground level quickly and safely.

"I got your messages," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I have located some more information. I thought I would share it with you. Where would it be safe to talk."

"The roof would be safe," I said. "the Terries are inside."

I thought Detective Roni Camberwell might object to this characterization, but she did not seem to notice that I had said this and that she also was a Terry.

"Very funny," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "How can I get up on the roof?"

"I will carry you," I said. "The anti-grav belt will work well for two."

"And how will you do that?"

"Like this," I said and stood up. I reached out with my forelegs and wrapped my arms around her. We lifted off the ground.

"Oh," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I didn't know you could do that."

"Very well," I said. "I just do not like doing it very often."

Detective Roni Camberwell wrapped her arms around my neck. I liked the way she felt in my legs and against my chest. I wondered if this is why terries do this often. They call it hugging.

"Do not look down," I said.

"I am certainly not going to do that," Detective Roni Camberwell said. She pressed her face into my fur.

When we were on the roof, I set us down carefully and let go of her. Detective Roni Camberwell staggered a bit, then regained her balance."

"Quite a view," she said, looking at the Pyramid volcano.

"Yes," I said. "It changes all the time. Every night it has different colors in different patterns."

"It has to do with the materials in the crust," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "We studied it in school though I don't remember a great deal."

"You don not remember?" I asked. "Is it not stored in your brain?"

"Probably," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I just don't know where."

"Why not?" I asked.

"What do you mean, why not?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.  "Don't you forget things?"

"No," I said. "Right now I cannot remember everything because my AI was destroyed on my ship. My new AI has not been given all of my data. That will happen when I get my new ship."

"You mean you have all your memory in a computer?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Not all of it," I said. "I have a rather large brain. I just store things in my AI's storage and my brain is regularly defragmenter and backed up. The AI and I work as one. Christabel, that is her name, can access my brain and I can access her storage. It is how star runners are able to pilot ships. We are part of its system while being a discrete individual."

"No kidding," Detect iv Roni Camberwell said. "So you are part machine?"

"Not like a robot," I said. "I am not metal. I am a living, breathing life form. I am especially engineered to work with artificial intelligence and computers."

"That's weird," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"No," I said, "it is not. I think it is weird that Terries do not have fur and wear clothes. It is like that."

I said this because I have had these discussions with Terries before. They all think it is odd that I am so dependent on my AI. I think it is strange not to be. I can analyze and refer to a lot more information than Terries can. I can see with the sensors of a ship.

"So what have you found out?" I asked.

"Stephen Silk was on he faculty of the University of the Mind on Socrates on the Northern Frontier," Detective Roni Camberwell said, sitting down on the roof. "He did not receive tenure. The reasons for this are behind a privacy wall, but I was able to learn the main objection to him was his political views. He advocates for the overthrow of the Pantheran Empire."

"I thought lots of Terries are for that," I said, "for withdrawal from the Coalition."

"Not just withdrawal from the Coalition," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "You're right. Lots of Terries believe it was a mistake for Earth and its colonies to join the Coalition. There is, apparently, no way to unjoin. 

"No, what Stephen Silk is advocating  fighting the Pantherans."

"He seems to be okay with me," I said.

"Because you are an androgen," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "He believes all androgens are oppressed by their masters and should be set free. It is the gendered Pantherans he has a vendetta against."

I thought about this. Christabel gave me a warning. It was a very strange warning. 
Fungusians was speaking to me as if this program had been inserted into Christabel's memory. "Captain Star Runner, the political organization of your race is more complicated and ancient than you have been led to believe in your Institute training. Although this information can be given to you, you have no frame of reference for it. We would advise that you refrain from engaging in such conversations. it will overload your system and that of your AI. There will be too many contradictions and logical errors. Your system could crash."

"OK," I said aloud and to Christabel and the phantom Fungusian, "so he has these political ideas. Why come here?"

"No one on Socrates could answer that question or would tell me what he might be up to here."

"And the others?" I asked.

"Your conversation with Tamara is perplexing. I can find Zoe Eisenhower in the Socrates records. As Tamara said, she left the University of the Mind. She also left Socrates. I can find no other trace of her.

\Shortly after Zoe Eisenhower left Socrates is when we hear of Zora O'Neill on the Southern Frontier robbing jewelry stores and museums. She has several convictions but has also escaped from incarceration. The obvious conclusion is they are one and the same person. Their physical descriptions don't match. Their DNA does not match. How Zora O'Neill learned of Zoe Eisenhower, if they are indeed two people, is still unknown."

"And Gail Jeffrey's?" I asked.

"Ah, yes, Gail Jeffrey's," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "We have no information on her at all. We have no record of Stephen Silk and Gail Jeffrey's marrying. We have no record of her even coming to the Hypatia."

"But clearly someone is here," I said.

"Clearly," Detective Roni Camberwell agreed. "We just don't know who she is."

"I could not find anything in the computer here about her," I said..

"That is not surprising. She apparently does not want to be traced."

 We sat quietly on the rooftop, gazing at the nightly display from the erupting volcano. Detective Roni Camberwell took my paw in her hand. I turned and began licking her ear and neck, washing her carefully. In time, she might come to enjoy a more through licking, but for now, I was as gentle I could be. She buried her face again in my neck. I began to purr.
Chapter Twenty-One
A Surprising Sighting

Detective Roni Camberwell and I agreed to meet for dinner at the Galactic Diner. It was a favorite waterhole for many people in the neighborhood as well as many of the people I had worked for and with on and off for a number of years. I was quite relieved not to be involved with the Library of the Mind anymore. Earlier that morning, after I left the Library of the Mind, I received a notice dismissing me. The anonymous note from the Library of the Mind's main account simply said I was no longer needed and they were sorry for any inconvenience. I was not let go--I refuse to use the word terminated--for any fault I had made. I thought this was all very strange. Detective Roni Camberwell thought it was because I knew too much and asked a lot of questions. The Library of the Mind had not counted on my excellent computer skills and my AI, Christabel.

However, the case had piqued my interest. I justified my continuing to ask questions and do research because of Zoe Eisenhower's connection to Tamara. I am always protective of Tamara. This is because Prudence Wu insisted I become her guardian many years ago. Tamara has explained that I am no longer her guardian, but I have decided to continue to look after her as I am able. She would do the same for me and has when necessary.

Before showing up at the Galactic Diner, I did some shopping. It took me some time to find the right store. This part of the Valley of the Kings is new to me. Yet it had many shops. I walked along the street, looking into the windows. This called window shopping. I find it is very helpful as I can catalog many items that are in each establishment and then I know where I can find something if I need it. Of course, the shops often sell the item I remember so I have to repeat the window shopping often to keep an up-to-date, albeit incomplete,listing. At last I find a store which sold long decorative scarves. All my scarves were lost in the explosion.

"May I help you?" a clerk asked, looking at me and the good in the shop rather doubtfully.

"I am looking to purchase a scarf," I said. "it must be long, filmy, and color coordinate with my fur."

"Yes, of course," the clerk said though I thought the tone of voice was somewhat doubtful. The clerk went into the back of the store and another Terry came out.

"You would like a scarf," the woman said. Perhaps she was the owner.

"Yes," I said. "A long one, to match my fur."

"We don't have any scarves your exact color," the woman said, "but I can show you several scarves which would look nice on yo."

"That is acceptable," I said.

She went to a display case and brought back the two scarves. One was black and gold. I did not like it. The other was a cream color with silver threads.

"I will take this one," I said. 

After I purchased it I said, "I will wear it out of the store."

"May I help you with it?" The woman asked.

"Yes," I said. "That would be very nice of you."

She came around the counter and draped the scarf over my neck, carefully tying it so I would not lose it. She also crossed the two ends over my back. I looked in the mirror. The scarf was not dragging on the ground.

"This is fine," I said. "Thank you."

And I left the shop, making my way to the Galactic Diner, dressed for an evening with Detective Roni Camberwell.

"You bought a scarf," Detective Roni Camberwell said when she came in and walked to my table.

"Yes," I said, "I remembered you said you saw me wearing them at Shepheard's Hotel. All my scarves were lost in the explosion so I bought a new one today."

"How nice of you," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "Did you know the pair of the silver are snowflakes?"

"Snowflakes?" I asked. "What are snowflakes?"

I could have Christabel give me a definition, of course, but I wanted to hear what Detective Roni Camberwell would say first.

"Snowflakes are water coming out of the sky when it is cold," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "They are a symbol of winter and since we are getting ready for Christmas, they are quite appropriate."

Christabel explained things a bit more clearly, though the idea of walking in this cold white wet accumulation did not sound at all appealing to me. Terries were a strange race.Why they would find such things attractive was beyond my comprehension. I have always like being in space where this sort of thing could be avoided. I realized that snow might be what the piles of red and blue were outside the dome. I asked Roni this.

"Yes," Detective Roni Camberwell said, "but the snow we think of is the kind thee is on Earth. That is what all the Christmas songs that mention snow are thinking about."

We ordered our food and sat happily chatting away about almost nothing at all. I decided this was a positive sign. It meant we were comfortable with one another. is romance was going vary well and Detective Roni Camberwell liked my scarf. I thought this must mean she liked females more than males. I would have to be more specific later tonight when we had sex. I wanted the right images from Christabel on this, pretending I, too, had a gendered body and that the gender was female. This is important to gendered beings as I understand it, to couple with a specific gender, at least, most of the time. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo once told me that coupling with me at all was considered a little odd by Terry standards. I wondered that the Fungusians had been careful to include this data in Christabel's memory. I was glad they had.

Detective Roni Camberwell excused herself from the table. Obviously a litter pan issue. I occupied myself by glancing around the diner. My eye fell on a particular person at the far end of the diner away from our table. I do not see particularly well, but something seemed familiar in a vague sort of way. Many Terries look alike to me. I breathed in deeply, letting me nose take the entire restaurant in, he smells of all the food stuffs and all he bodies in the diner. Terries spend a lo of time covering their scents with artificial perfumes. I closed my eyes, letting the aromas fill me mind. It was easy to sort them out, setting the food smells aside and then searching for a Terry scent that matched all the smells in my database. I would find out who this person was.

The answer startled me.

According to my smell history, which I maintained as a high priority task, the person in that booth was King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road. However, his clothes were different and he was not waving a stick around shouting, "A horse, a horse, a kingdom for a horse." He was talking to a woman, a woman I knew--Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. She had not notified me of her presence though she had clearly stated in her message to me that she would contact me when she arrived in Ptolemy City. I was hurt and perplexed.

I wanted to jump up and rush right over to that table and make inquiries. Christabel advised against this.

"Star, you do not know what is going on here," Christabel said. "There may be a very good reason why Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo has no contacted you yet. She may be protecting you."

"And she may be deceiving me," I replied. "Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo has deceived me in the past."

I did not know all the circumstances, just the fact. A note attached to this item indicated that it was to protect me, hence Christabel's counsel.

"I do not like this," I said. "Why is she talking to someone who claims he is King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road and who lives in the Fends?"

"You remember Emily Dickinson told you King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, lived in the Fends voluntarily and that he protected you from the authorities when they scanned Emily Dickinson island for wireless devices."

"Yes," I said. "But why?"

"We do not know why," Christabel said reasonably. "We will have to find out later. Here comes Detective Roni Camberwell."

Christabel was right. Here was my new lover, looking fresh. This was going to be a wonderful night. I was on a date and I liked that. I liked Detective Roni Camberwell, too, her company, her smell, and, yes, how she acted when I touched her in bed. It is gratifying to know I have learned to do this and I get touched in special ways in response. I need to run a program to have an orgasm, but that is okay. That programming in my brain is still in tact and it is a privilege of mature androgens to run the programs of their choosing. Juveniles are restricted so they will study hard. I certainly did though I figured out very quickly how to find and use these programs secretly.

"Where shall we go?" I asked as Detective Roni Camberwell and I stepped out of the Galactic Diner onto the Valley of the Kings.

"Towards Shepheard's Hotel,"Detective Roni Camberwell said. "They are going to light the tree tonight."

"What?" I said. "How do you light a tree? I did not know there were trees here."

"it is not a real tree," Detective Roni Camberwell said as we walked along together."It is an artificial tree. It's our community Christmas tree. It is lit with colored lights every year to kick off the Christmas season. We all go there, the lights are turned on, and we cheer. We also sing a few songs about the Christmas tree."

She demonstrated.

"Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, how ever green your branches."

"The branches are green?" I asked. 

"Yes, because Christmas trees are conifers," Detective Roni Camberwell said proudly. "It is a very old kind of tree back on Earth."

"Have you ever been to Earth?" I asked.

"Of course not," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I've never left the Pharaoh Star System. But our teachers taught us all this in school. I once did a report on the kinds of trees used for Christmas trees on Earth."

"You put Christmas presents under these trees," I said.

"Yes, that's right," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "How did you know that when you don't seem to know anything about Christmas trees?"

My adventure with Santa Claus is not one of my adventures I have published. It is still a difficult one for me.

"I know about Santa Claus," I said.

"How?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

I knew I could not say because I have met Santa Claus. That was art of my contract, not to say that to anyone. So I said, "It was part of a job I once did--a long time ago. I retain this piece of information."

It was a long walk to Shepheard's Hotel, but we arrived in [plenty of time. Lots of people were gathered there, even children. Everyone it seemed in Ptolemy City was there. I had never seen so many Terries at once.

Someone dressed like an elf turned the lights on the tree. We all cheered and some music started playing. Everyone began singing. I sang, too. Detective Roni Camberwell began laughing and poked me in he ribs.

"Star," Detective Roni Camberwell said, "you sound like a cat on a back fence."

"Have you ever heard a cat yowling on a back fence?" I asked.

"In videos," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

I ignored this and finished the song.

"I like singing," I said. "It is one of the Terry inventions I like."

"You must like Terries a lot to live and work here," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"Some Terries," I said.

"Look!" everyone around us shouted. "Look!"

At first I did not understand what to look it.

"It's snowing," Detective Roni Camberwell said excitedly. "Do you see the snowflakes, Star?"

I did. They were more raindrops in the shape of snowflakes than snow, but I saw them. They fell all over me. It was like getting wet, but had a very gentle feel about it.

The snowstorm, if that is what people called it, did not last long, but everyone laughed and cheered. As the crowd broke up, everybody said it was the best tree lighting they had ever been to.

As we walked along the Valley of the Kings, Detective Roni Camberwell resting her large hand on my shoulder, I instructed Christabel to create a subroutine to keep me from thinking about Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road. I would deal with those questions in the morning. There was also a safeguard so that if it was necessary to think about either of these two persons, Christabel would bring me back into consciousness about them. For now, I wanted to focus on Detective Roni Camberwell. I was looking forward to our lovemaking. Even an androgen can look forward to a romantic evening.

It was, I must say, quite something. Detective Roni Camberwell let me touch her all over, even to nipping her gently. She pretended to do all the things she would normally do with another woman to me while encouraging me to do them to her as well as I was able. Christabel wrote some highly original routines to simulate the experience for me and touch those places in my brain where my undeveloped sexuality was stored. Although my memories of other lovers were undefined, I was quite certain no one had ever been like her. Detective Roni Camberwell was neither shy nor timid. She enjoyed her body and mine. 

In the morning my new lover--I decided I could also name Detective Roni Camberwell that for convenience--went off to work, promising I would have more information on Deadly Dudley and thunder Bone Bobby this evening. Even though I was not at the Library of the Mind--the arson fire in the basement had accomplished that--I believed I was still in danger. Somehow I had introduced myself into whatever was going on at the library and it would not be forgotten. I knew something, though what I knew that would upset some Terry I did not know.

I went in search of a simple breakfast. Christabel could object all she wanted about my diet, but I wanted pancakes after my blissful evening. Christabel pointed out that having an AI who could adjust my biology was no excuse for poor maintenance of my body, yet one of the pleasures I have enjoyed as an independent androgen is physical contact and eating real food. 

"No," Christabel reminded me, "what you eat is quite real. You just get most of it intravenously and what Terries eat is not real to you. You are a Pantheran."

"Do not gendered Pantherans eat different food?" I asked.

"I do not know," Christabel said.

"Neither do I," I said though I thought it quite probable I knew once and would know again when my memories were restored. Happy day. this not knowing was very inconvenient and time-consuming. Christabel pointed out that searching a large database was time-consuming.

"However," I said, "you will do it quite quickly, in no time at all, as the Terries say."

Christabel made a noise that simulated a sniff.

"For someone who prides itself on being a member of he dominant race in this part of the galaxy, you certainly put a lot stock in what Terries say and do."

"I live among them," I said. "Are they not my social norm?"

"You are a social norm unto yourself," Christabel replied, a bit haughtily, I thought, but it was not a day to get into a snit with my AI. That was for long voyages when there was nothing else to do.

There was a pancake house where the Lower Nile became the Upper Nile. It was a transitional area. Many tourists staying at the top-of-the-line hotels came around Lake Memphis this far. They thought of it as mixing with the locals. Of course, only the well-to-do locals frequented this area. The rents were fairly high here.

"Captain Star Runner," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo called. "Here you are."

"Yes," I said. "Here you are yourself."

"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was sitting alone. I joined here.

When did you get in?" I asked.

"Last night," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"And what are you doing here?" I asked. I went straight to the point. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo would either tell me why she was here or she would not. 

"I have an assignment to check something out in this area of space," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"And it is confidential," I said.

"Very confidential," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. Unexpectedly she added, "it could be very dangerous to a lot of people, my inquiring. Watch your back, Star. You could be collateral damage."

My memory banks were stripped of much information, but I doubted Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo had ever said such a thing to me before. I felt certain it would have been kept in the database.

"And you are protecting me by not telling me?" I asked. "Is that wise?"

"At this time," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "I am hoping to be out of here quickly and on to another area of space."

"So your visit here is short?" I inquired.

"Very short. I will be off again in another day or so."

"So we do not have much time," I said.

"I am sorry. We do not," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Perhaps on the other end of the investigation, I can return here."

"That sounds very weak to me," I said. "You and I both know you rarely have any time between assignments."

"True,"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo agreed.  "But we've been all through that, Star, do you remember?"

"A hundred times or more," I said.

"So let's not get into that now," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"No," I said. "Christabel is writing a routine now to handle it."

"Christabel?"

"My new AI," I said. "She has a name and a personality. I like her. She is very," I searched for the right word, "smooth."

"Girly?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"No," I said. "I do not like girly. I like women to be strong,firm. No, Christabel is easy on the mind. I do not need to order her to do something. We are very compatible, very intertwined."

"You sound like you have become lovers," Captain Gyllian Romeres said.

"No," I said. "Christabel is gentle. My lover is not."

"Oh, you found someone here?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Are you going to be jealous?" I asked.

"Yes, I think so," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "I like thinking you are here waiting for me."

"But you are rarely here," I said.

"And this is someone local?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Yes," I said. "Born on Hypatia, as a matter of fact."

"Well, that will work out nicely for you," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

'I do not know if it will work out as you say," I said. "It is not an exclusive relationships far as I know. You and I have been through this a hundred times or more, too."

"It is not quite the same when you are saying that," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "than when I say it to you."

We were quiet. I thought about this.

"Was I unkind?" I asked.

"You were your usual blunt self," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "It is one of your most endearing characteristics. It does mean you usually tell me straight out that you are making love to someone else when I wanted you all to myself which is unfair and unreasonable and to be expected of me."

"OK," I said. "You will need to make time to make love to me, that is all. You know I will always want to do that with you and talk to you and travel in spaceships with you."

"That is true," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We just don't live lives where that happens very often."

"Especially when I do not have a ship," I said.

"Will it be much longer?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Neither the Fungusians or the Plumies are saying right now," I said.

"That must be very hard for you," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"It is," I said.

"Where are you staying?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"I am staying at Emily Dickinson's apartment."

"But he is not your lover." Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo stated the obvious.

"No," I said. "Emily Dickinson is exiled on the Fends."

"Why?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was truly startled and taken aback.

"Some slander or other," I said. "He will be out of there in a few weeks."

"So Eberhardt offered you his apartment when you lost your ship?"

"No," I said. "I was the night security guard at the Library of the Mind for a little while. Then there was an arson fire to get me out of there and I stopped being the night security guard. That is when I moved into Emily Dickinson's apartment."

"A fire? Were you hurt?"

"I was not there," I said. "I was with Detective Roni Camberwell at the tie."

"Your lover?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"And someone investigating the people at the Library of the Mind," I said.

"What people?"

"Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey's and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe)," I said "but there is a problem."

"Not here, star," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We need to talk about this somewhere else."

Her entire manner had changed. This was Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo in full Intelligence Officer mode. I had said something that had to do with her case.

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo got up and we left the pancake house. 

"Can you find your way to the Fends alone?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Of course," I said. "I have been there several times
You do need to deal with king Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester road.  He has the next island."

"Oh," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

But she was not quick enough to hide her surprise at that piece of information.

I walked away from her and did not look back. That was part of the game Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was always playing. 
Sometime sit worked. sometimes it did not work. Either way, I played the game  as best I could for her sake. It was another reason we did not spend as much time together as we would like. I temporarily set aside via another quickly produced subroutine by Christabel, the question of the two women. My new lover, if she learned about captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo, would have to decide on her own what to do. I could have sex with each other serially or together for that matter. I enjoyed them both. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was my good friend. It remained to be seen if Detective Roni Camberwell would be my long-time friend, too. I had three friends. Emily Dickinson would be my third long-time friend. I was certain about that. We had weathered our storm in an adventure. That made us friends always.

The water in the Delta was higher today. This happened from time to time. Stupidly, I tried not to step in the water, holding first this and that paw up but the truth is, I can't unbalanced like that. It occurred to me that I could stand up and keep at least two paws out of the water.

"A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse," King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road shouted, waving his stick.

"Pardon me," I said. "Do you know of a dryer route to Emily Dickinson island?"

"Enemies all around," King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road shouted. "Beware. Beware."

"At the moment," I said reasonably, "there seems to be water all around."

"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink," King Richard I declaimed.

He pointed with his stick."Yonder lies your path, my boy. Yonder tread with careful step."

"Thank you," I said, seeing that although the path he indicated was not the most direct route, it would bring me to a point where I could jump across several very small islets to reach Emily Dickinson's shack.

The madness, I saw, was a cover. King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, whoever he was and whatever his business was Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo, could be spoken with. It was necessary to reinterpret what he said and watch carefully what he did. I wondered who he really was.

I made my way, continuing to dislike the feel of water, to Emily Dickinson's island and, at last, could walk four-footed to his door.

"Pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said when he finally opened the door, "do you know how early it is?"

"Past breakfast," I said. "Of course I know how early it is."

I went inside.

Emily Dickinson look exceedingly sallow and rumpled. His exile was having a bad effect on him. Emily Dickinson likes Terran company which may sound odd for a Terry who makes a good living as an assassin. He once explained to me that the business of assassination, for him, was not a personal matter. It was a matter of skill and therefore was a problem to be solved. He had no moral concerns because he did not take commissions which he found to be morally repugnant. The people he killed, he said, needed killing and there were many of them.

Tamara disagreed with Emily Dickinson, believing there was no cause for one Terran to kill another. My two friends had never met. I wondered what they would think of each other.

No matter for the time being, Christabel reminded me. I needed to talk to Emily Dickinson.

"So how's the old homestead?" Emily Dickinson asked as he sat down on his bunk with a fresh cup of imitation coffee. "I hate this swill," he said, "but it's better than nothing."

"Your apartment is quite comfortable," I said. "Thank you for letting me borrow it. I like going to the Galactic Diner."

"Don't rub it in," Emily Dickinson said. "It sure beats these meal packs I have to eat. Have you tried the apple pancakes?"

"Not yet," I said. "I will make a note to order them next time I go there."

"You see the cute waitress? I forget her name--the blonde?"

"I would not be able to ascertain if a blonde woman was cue," I said. "I can only read name tags. I will make a catalog of hem and then review them with you."

"Not necessary, pussy cat. She's probably not your type."

"My type?" I asked.

"wanting to roll around in the hay with a pussy cat," Emily Dickinson explained unhelpfully.

"Do you mean sex?" I asked.

"Of course I mean sex," Emily Dickinson said.

"Have you rolled around in the hay with this waitress?" I asked.

"No such luck," Emily Dickinson said.

Christabel explained what hay is. It seemed an odd product to roll around in. I made a note to follow up on this turn of phrase for more information at a future date.

"When I went to the Galactic Diner last night," I said, "I saw Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo with King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road at another booth, talking to each other."

"What?" Emily Dickinson sloshed his coffee around. "You saw the crazy king with Gyllie at the Galactic Diner. He never leaves the Delta.

"Apparently," I said. "He does."

"Are you sure?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"Quite certain," I said. "What do you know about this King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road besides his pretended madness."

"That's the thing," Emily Dickinson said. "I believed it. Now you are suggesting it is an act."

"Very definitely a pretense," I said. "I asked a question this morning and, although he said some very strange things to me, he gave me perfectly good directions to get here without getting too wet."

"Hmm," Emily Dickinson said. "and he and Gyllie know each other. That suggests he is either from the Alliance or they know each other from Terran Intelligence."

"Then you might really know him?" I asked.

"No," Emily Dickinson said. "Gyllie was there longer and was of a much higher rank. The other possibility is that she doesn't know him and was put in touch with him."

"It is supposed to be a secret," I said. "Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was supposed to contact me when she arrived in Ptolemy City, but she waited until she saw me at the Galactic Diner this morning. She seemed very surprised I came to visit you here in the Delta and therefore knew King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road. I think if you keep a lookout, you will learn something. I believe she will visit you soon."

"And you took it upon yourself to tell me," Emily Dickinson said.

"I came partly to ask you if you could explain any of this to me," I said. "I also came to tell you I have learned any significant about the three Terries at the Library of the Mind. Stephen Silk appears to be what he says he is. He wants to free the Terries from the members of my race and free the androgens from slavery. There is confusion about Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe). Tamara knew a Zoe Eisenhower in school but she left the University of the Mind before graduation. There is a person named Zora O'Neill on the Southern Frontier who is a jewel thief. Gail Jeffrey's has no record at all."

"Well, that isn't very helpful," Emily Dickinson said, "but it is peculiar. Those people bear watching. I can see why you are interested. You are, in a small way, a target and Tamara is tangentially connected to these people."

"I do not understand why they are here," I said, "and I do not understand the arson directed toward me at the Library of the Mind. I would like to understand all that."

"And when you want to understand something, there is no persuading you to let it go," Emily Dickinson said.

"That is correct," I said. "I now have the mystery of Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road to solve. I hope this will be a simple mystery. Detective Roni Camberwell and I are meeting this evening. She says she will have more information on Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby. Packages Promptly has reference to a package which was deleted from its system. No one seems to know why."

"Questions. Questions. Questions," Emily Dickinson said. "Didn't they tell you at school some things are just mysteries."

"No," I said. "They said an anomalies we encounter have explanations and we should find them."

"Well, that may be true of spaceships," Emily Dickinson said, "but not of life."

"I do not understand the difference," I said.

"No, you probably wouldn't," Emily Dickinson said. "Life is more complicated than running a spaceship, pussy cat. You still don't believe that. Maybe you'll never believe that. Well, let me see what I can find out for you when and if Gyllie comes by. I'll also spy on my neighbor and see what I can figure out."

"Thank you," I said.

I got up to leave.

"Pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said, "you're a trip. Your visits cheer me up and make me laugh."

"Is that a good thing?" I asked.

"Sitting on this rock all day," Emil Dickinson said, "you bet. Thanks for coming."Detective Roni Camberwell and I agreed to meet at the Pirate Ship. This is a famous landmark in Ptolemy City. It is not really a ship. It is a building which looks like a sunken pirate ship. It has high-end stores, restaurants and other forms of entertainment. I was looking forward to spending time with my new lover on the Pirate Ship and what came afterwards. 

Although I do not typically walk on my hind legs, I decided the crowds made it advisable to do. It meant I stood taller than 


Chapter Twenty-Five
I Spend An Evening with Detective Roni Camberwell
all the Terries around me. They gave way and I strode along, knowing Detective Roni Camberwell could easily spot me. We had agreed to meet at the restaurant. It was one I did not know on the upper level.

In truth, I was surprised Detective Roni Camberwell had suggested it. I do not know a great deal about Terry gendered behavior, but picking such a fancy restaurant seemed unusual. What was going on? Was something special going to happen or was I being made a fool of? I hoped not. I liked Detective Roni Camberwell. There was something very relaxing about her. Of course, we only talked about her investigation and our lovemaking. Maybe that would need to change and this restaurant might help things along.

"Star," Detective Roni Camberwell said as I stepped over the escalator ramp. "You look impressive standing up."

"Thank you," I said. "I thought it was advisable given the crowds here."

"Yes, and I had no trouble seeing you. Wow are you tall."

"I am average for a star runner," I said.

"Somehow the word average does not seem to fit you at all."

"I am a unique color," I said, "but I am average in size and build."

"I thought you would be all alike," Detective Roni Camberwell said, slipping her hand into my paw.

"There is some variation," I said. "We are not cloned. We are engineered which is very different."

"The restaurant is down here," Detective Roni Camberwell said, pulling into a narrower corridor. "I wanted to come here for the view. It reminds me of the rooftop view you gave me at the library of the mind."

The restaurant was on the top level with its own dome so that diners could look out and see through the Ptolemy City Dome. The Pyramid Volcano was quite active this evening which is varying array of colors and size of its plumes of steam and magma. We were escorted to a table alongside the window.

"Are you afraid of heights?" Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"Yes and no," I said, settling down on the carpet next to the table.

"I still find open space uncomfortable but I am getting used to it. I know I have a wall here even though I can see through it and my AI will insure I experience no vertigo. It is necessary to have such subroutines in space."

meat.


"Can I ask you a personal question?"

"That depends," I said.

"How much of a computer are you?"

"I'm not really a computer at all," I said. "I simply am integrated with an artificial intelligence which is a computer. The trade-off to do this is that I require the AI, the computer part, to manage my biological systems. I have no innate ability to do that."
"So you're dependent on a computer. If it was taken away, you would be helpless."

"Not helpless," I said. "ill. I'm protected against that now. I have a micro-system imbedded in me that can maintain my biological needs for a long period of time in case I need to or become separated from my main AI. That is what happened when my ship exploded. I needed to be dependent on my micro system until Christabel arrived."

"And Christabel knows everything we're doing," Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Christabel is not a third person," I said. "Christabel is an artificial intelligence. It is not you, me and Christabel. It is you and me."

"But it's Christabel who makes you like it," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"I simply ask Christabel to run a biological program of my choosing," I said. "You could just as easily choose the program's parameters. There are safeguards so I do not get hurt."

Detective Roni Camberwell stared at me. "That is just too weird," she said.

"I gather you are having some difficulties with how things are," I said.

Detective Roni Camberwell frowned. "I'm not sure," she said. "At times it seems perfectly normal and at other times, it seems creepy."

"Like I am not human," I said, using an old word for her race.

"Exactly," Detective Roni Camberwell said. She perked up.

"It is not human," I said. "You have to decide whether or not that is okay with you."

"I think I started asking myself what sort of future we would have," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"Future?" I asked. 

"Yes, you know, dating, living together, that sort of thing."

Christabel extrapolated to marriage and children.

I studied the menu. This was definitely a high-end restaurant. Christabel made some suggestions. We dickered. I elected to have a vegetable dish with whole wheat pasta and tofu. The sauce might be a little rich, but there was no 

"Captain Star Runner," a familiar voice called.

The Czarina came to our table looking regal as always.

"Is this your new sweetheart?" The Czarina asked, looking Detective Roni Camberwell over critically. Detective Roni Camberwell blushed at the Czarina's scrutiny.

"Detective Roni Camberwell," I said, "this is the Czarina. I usually see her at Shepheard's Hotel or at Dish Dish on Over the Moon."

"Yes, but with all the construction on the space station Dish Dish is so disagreeable," the Czarina said. "And Shepheard's can be so stuffy. Much more exciting to be out on the town at this time of year."

The Czarina was, as usual, alone. Fortunately we were sitting at a table for two. It would be impossible for her to join us and I did not think that even the Czarina would suggest it.

"Captain Star Runner," the Czarina continued, "I know you are having dinner with your date and I do not mean to intrude, but I thought you ought to know that Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby are in town. I just saw them out on the street."

"Where?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Oh, I passed them on the way from Shepheard's," the Czarina said vaguely. "I don't know exactly where?"

"But you're sure it was them?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Of course," the Czarina said. "I was married to the scoundrel long enough never to forget."

Chapter Twenty-Six
The Scoundrels Move Against Me

I pulled up the Czarina's tab on the menu display inserted into the table. A few flicks of my paw added credit to her considerable deficit.

"Thank you, darling," the Czarina said, blowing me a noisy kiss. "I'll let you two lovebirds eat your dinner in peace." And she walked away to the bar, sitting down next to a well-to-do gentleman and beginning to entice him with her charms in hopes of getting her bar bill decreased.

"You know her well?" asked Detective Roni Camberwell.

"Do you not know the Czarina?" I asked. I assumed everybody knew her. The Czarina was that sort of person, locally famous.

"I know who she is," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I've never met her."

"The Czarina is okay," I said. "When the chips were down, she came through with some pretty important info for me a while back. The Czarina sells information and you pay by adding to her account at whatever establishment you find her in. The system works well enough for me. I had asked her about Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby a few days ago. I paid. Now the Czarina has given me more information and I paid again."

"And her information is reliable?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Yes," I said. "As you heard, the Czarina could not or would not give us explicit information as to the whereabouts of Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby, but, as far as it goes, her information is reliable. The Czarina chooses what to share when however."

"That's a dangerous game to play," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"The Czarina has been playing the information game for a long time. It is all she has to live on as far as I know."

Our food arrived. I pondered the flatware. I can manage a spoon but the knife and fork have always eluded me. I had had the presence of mine not to order spaghetti or fettuccini. They proved beyond my skill level. The whole wheat spirals could be scooped up.

"You were going to tell me what you learned about Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby," I said after a few mouthfuls.

"Oh, yeah," Detective Roni Camberwell said distractedly.

"They're pirates, of course. They mostly work the Eastern Gate, taking hostages and demanding ransoms. it's a nasty business."

"And their relationship to the Terries at the Library of the Mind?" I prompted.

"None that I can find."

I decided Detective Roni Camberwell as not paying attention to either me or her food. Her attention was behind me. Unless I turned around, I could not see. I have a wider peripheral vision than Terries, but it is not a full three hundred and sixty degrees.

"What are you looking at?" I asked.

"I believe Stephen Silk is sitting behind you," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I do not want to talk if there is a chance he will hear us."

"Who is he with?" I asked.

"Some other gentlemen," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "None of them are familiar to me. I know most of the Board of Directors and the higher ups at the League of Hypatian Pirates. These men are well-dressed, however."

"I will look at them on our way out and have Christabel do a check," I said. "I can also transmit the pictures to you."

"I can snap them with my com," Detective Roni Camberwell pointed out.

"Can it do a visual check?" I asked.

"Probably not as successfully as you can," Detective Roni Camberwell admitted.

This date was going all wrong. I knew that. It had been wrong since Detective Roni Camberwell wondered aloud if it was just weird to be with me. I wondered what I could do to change our conversation or the mood. I thought very hard.

"You know," I said, licking some sauce off my paw delicately, "I like your hands very much."

"My hands?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"Yes," I said. "They are quite large and they fit so well with the size of my paw."

"I don't think of you having paws," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I think of you having hands."

I considered my paw.

"It is definitely a paw," I said."

This was not the right thing to say. Detective Roni Camberwell seemed to shrink inside herself.

"I've got to go," Detective Roni Camberwell said suddenly. She got up and started walking across the restaurant toward the exit. I considered what to do. I could easily stop her. That did not seem like the right thing to do. I could ask her to come back to the table That would draw more attention to us. That did not seem right either. Apparently, Detective Roni Camberwell was having difficulty extending her perspective to include me. Many Terries had this problem. I was just sad that she was one of hem. I really liked being with Detective Roni Camberwell and I thought our relationship would grow, not end suddenly in the middle of dinner.

I finished my dinner, paid the bill and got up, turning slowly to scan the room, carefully looking at all the faces around me as if I were looking for someone. I made certain to look at each Terry at Stephen Silk's table. he had his back to me so could not see that I was staring.

I paused by the Czarina as I left.

"Your girl friend left in a hurry," the Czarina said.

"Yes," I said. "I do not know why."

"if it means anything," the Czarina said quietly, not in her usual strident voice, "she was crying."

That meant she was unhappy whether with me or with herself or with something else I did not know. I decided the Czarina was trying to be helpful, not mean. The Czarina could be very mean to other people but she was never mean to me. I put a little more on her tab and left the restaurant.

My evening would be a lonely one. I did not know where Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was. She had not contacted me since I left her on the sidewalk outside of the Galactic Diner. Emily Dickinson was still banished. Detective Roni Camberwell had run out of the restaurant crying. 

Ah. I would look for Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby. Perhaps they would tell me if they had any contact with Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey's and/or Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe).

I made my way out onto the street and started walking, on all fours, toward Shepheard's Hotel. I would check at the Queen Nefertiti Bar.

I had no gone far when a catastrophic occurrence alarm went off in my head. Christabel's base unit at Emily Dickinson's apartment was being compromised. From behind a firebreak,, more secure than a firewall,  I observed the base unit erasing all my biological interfaces. Next the AI would delete all her databases and finally her entire operating system. Her sensors were down. I could not see who was attacking her, only that an attack was in progress. My processes had been immediately transferred to the base station at the Ferris Lighthouse spaceport.  I sent three messages: one to Detective Roni Camberwell to alert the police to the vandalism, the second I sent to Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and the third I sent to the Fungusians so that a replacement base station could be sent. Then I started retracing my steps to Emily Dickinson's apartment. There was not a caravan car to be had on such a busy evening.

By the time I finally got to the side street off of the Lower Nile, I was running as far as I could go which is, I must admit, quite fast.The AI inside the apartment was dead. She had accomplished her mission, making anything still left inside unusable and unreadable. I was safe so long as my secondary system did not fail. With my implant, I would be biologically regulated, but its storage capacity was limited. I would be in severe memory loss if something happened to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport base station.

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo was standing on the sidewalk when I run up to her.

"What is happening?" I was breathing quite heavily.

"The police are inside. There is no sign of the intruder," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "They can't find any evidence either. Whoever did this was quite professional."
"This was no random act of violence," I said. "This was quite specific."

"Agreed," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. Are you aware of any threats against you."

"Not--" I stopped speaking. Christabel was updating me, having just been notified by the League of Hypatian Pirates.

"Yes," I corrected myself. "I am now targeted by a group called the Association for the Rise of Human Endeavors. Have you heard of this group?"

All the color had drained from Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo's face.

"Yes," she said, "I have, Star. It is why I am here. You are in grave danger. We should leave this  place. Does your information say who specifically is hunting you?"

The word "hunting" sounded ominous.

"The local contract," I said, "is being executed by Deadly Dudley and Thunder bone Bobby."

"This is very bad," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Come with me, quickly."

I followed her unquestioningly. Time and time again Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo had proved I could trust her implicitly when it came to my well-being.

Chapter Twenty-Seven
I Learn About Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo's Mission

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo hurried away from Emily Dickinson's apartment. I had no difficulty keeping up with her. We did not talk. She flagged down a caravan and punched in an address. I did not see what it was, though it quickly became apparent we going to the Fends. Did this have something to do with King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road?

The caravan line did not go all the way to the Fends. We got up and began walking quickly again. The water was high. I braced myself for getting wet. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo looked around, uncertain.

"This way," I said, and began leading the way.

"How do you know where we are going?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"You are looking for King Richard I, duke of the Gloucester Road," I said.

Despite the urgency of the moment, Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo laughed. "Who?"

"He calls himself King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road," I said. "I saw you with him at the Galactic Diner last evening," I said, "before you officially notified me you were in town. I decided he was part of your assignment here."

"You are correct," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "He did not tell me you had been in the Fends."

"Emily Dickinson's island is next to his," I said. "I cross over there to get to Emily Dickinson."

I hurried as much as I could, though wet feet and splattered water is not an induce to run. I could run faster but I did not want to leave Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo behind.

"Who goes there?" demanded King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, blocking my path. "Do you have a horse. A horse. A horse--"

"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo needs you," I said, "breaking into his refrain.

King Richard I did not change his expression.

"Where is the lass?"

"Coming around the corner, now," I said. "I was leading the way."

"There have been disturbing developments," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We need to talk, Richard."

Without a greeting or a word of acknowledgement, King Richard I turned and stalked to his island. I was uncertain whether I was invited to this conference. I looked over to Emily Dickinson island and saw him. I went to the shoreline.

"Trouble," I said, "your apartment was broken into. My base station was attacked. it has cannibalized itself."

"Is that Gyllie?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"Yes," I said. "She knows King Richard I. I believe he is in disguise. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo says I am in grave danger but I do not know why. She has come here to talk with King Richard I."

"I'm coming over," Emily Dickinson said. "Hold on."

"But," I said.

"To hell with regulations," Emily Dickinson said. "It's my apartment and it's my sublet and it's my friend at stake."

Emily Dickinson did not call me pussy cat. This was another indication the situation was quite serious.

Together we went to King Richard I's cabin. Emily Dickinson opened the door without knocking. We went in.

Inside the cabin there was a single room though it was well maintained and quite neat. This was not a penal cell but a home. I wondered how long King Richard I had lived here.

With the four of us in the cabin, it felt a little crowded.. King Richard I looked sternly at each of us as we entered. He stood up. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo motioned him down.

"It's okay," Richard," she said. "You know Star and Emily Dickinson. I've worked with each of them before. Star was targeted in an attack at Emily Dickinson's apartment. You won't have heard of him, but Emily Dickinson once worked for Terran Intelligence as Eberhardt Stein."

"The Whiskey Sour  affair," King Richard I said.

"Then my infamy precedes me," Emily Dickinson said.

"Indeed," King Richard I said.

"Sit down," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We do not have much time and you two need to be brought up to speed to understand and be of assistance."

I sat on the floor. Emily Dickinson sat on the bunk. There were only two chairs.

"As you know," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "spaceships leave the Coalition through the Eastern Gate. Pirates prey upon these ships. Often tourist passenger liners are escorted by armed ships and they travel in convoys."

We nodded. Speech did not seem an option.

"Many of the League of Hypatian Pirates target lucrative vessels and rob the passengers. Some are held for ransom."

We nodded again. Still nothing new here.

"However," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "Terran Intelligence became aware other ships were leaving through the eastern gate. Richard works for Terran Intelligence. The simplest way to describe these ships is to call them slave ships."

"Slave ships," Emily Dickinson exclaimed. "There are slavers out here?"

"Not human slaves," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Pantheran slaves."

"Pantheran slaves," I expostulated.

"Androgens," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo explained, "surplus androgens to be exact."

I was very quiet.

"Terrans are engaging in a practice of gathering up Pantherans--we don't know if they are enticing them with promises of care and work or if they are being kidnapped and traded to the slave ships. What we do know if hey are being taken to a nuclear waste site called Landscape of Thorns."

Emily Dickinson whistled. "Nasty, nasty," he said. "I've heard of that one. it's gigantic."

"Yes," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Apparently, the androgens are involved in some sort of recovery or excavation process. Of course, they get radiation sickness and die."

"This is very upsetting," I said. "I certainly want this process stopped. What I do not understand is why you and Terran Intelligence are involved."

"Because our people are involved inside the Coalition," King Richard I said. "Inside the Coalition, the Solar League is subject to legal restrictions requiring noninterference in domestic matters. Surplus androgens come under that provision."

"And you, Gyllie?" Emily Dickinson said.

"The Alliance and other groups are concerned that this trade would give the Coalition reason to come across the Northern and Southern Frontiers and maybe even through the Eastern Gate," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "It is also believed that the Human Endeavor Revolutionary group is involved and they had their start on Socrates at the University of the Mind."

"Which brings us to Stephen Silk and his political views," I said.

"Agreed," King Richard I said.

"We also believe," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "that Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby are engaging in the slave trade."

"The Czarina said she saw them here," I said.

"The Czarina told you that?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Yes, at dinner tonight," I said. "I was going in search of them when my base station came under attack. Do you believe they were responsible?"

"Yes, I do," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "or someone like them."

"What kind of an attack was it?" King Richard I asked. "Could you tell?"

I thought for a moment. Christabel and I reviewed the sequence of events.

"It was not so much an attack," I said. "It was not destructive to the base station itself, like someone taking a hammer  and striking it. It was examined.  
Christabel, my AI, thinks it might have been picked up."

"Then someone might have been trying to steal it," Emily Dickinson said. "That would make sense if you are dealing with other androgens. The person may think it would work with another androgen, not realizing the amount of customization which is generally necessary and how much different you system is from the standard model."

"Agreed," I said. "But what does it all mean?"

"The simplest explanation," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "is these slave traders want you, Star. That is why I wanted to get you out of there as soon as I could. I don't know if you are targeted."

"Another possible motive," King Richard I said, "is that they want to  eliminate you because you have been asking a lot of questions. I did tell you to beware."

"Yes," I said. "I have been trying to be careful."

None of the Terries said anything to that. I decided they must think I am not very careful.

"Incoming message," Christabel said.

I braced for more bad news.

It was a text, a hurried text, from Detective Roni Camberwell. 

"help," it read. "I'm in trouble. Help."

I jumped up.

"Detective Roni Camberwell is in trouble," I said. "We must go."

"Go where?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"The Library of the Mind," I said. "She ran away from me at dinner tonight. She was very upset. I do not think she would call me if there was not a great need."

"Let's go," Emily Dickinson said.

"You cannot leave," I said.

"Hell's bells, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said, "it's my apartment that has been broken into, my pussy cat who has been targeted and the same police force that put me here that is in trouble. I'm tired of this fucking place. Let's go."

We went.

Chapter twenty-Eight
The Czarina makes a Request

As we made our way to the caravan line, another message came in. This time it was a voice message. It was The Czarina.

"Star," the Czarina did not look at all elegant. Her make-up was smeared. Her clothes were disarrayed. She looked frightened. Her hair was mussed, too. "Star, I need help. Dudley--"

The message cut off.

"The Czarina is in trouble, too," I said. "It is something to do with Deadly Dudley."

"Do you know where she is?" King Richard I asked.

I checked the coordinates.

"The Library of the Mind," I said.

"Definitely trouble," King Richard I said.

There was one camel caravan, the one we had left.

"You two get in," Emily Dickinson said to King Richard I and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. "You go to the Library of the Mind. We will meet you there. You are more official than we are."

That was certainly true, especially Emily Dickinson. At this point, he was an escaped prisoner. He could be shot on sight though I doubted this would actually happen. Ptolemy City is becoming a more refined place than that these days but it would be legal.

Emily Dickinson and I began walking. Thee were no caravans in sight.

"This way," I said, letting Christabel guide us.

"We'll come in from the back, through the alleys."

 We found Market Street and I led us off into an unnamed alley. 

"Where the hell are we?" Emily Dickinson grumbled.

"We're going to intersect with Thieves' Alley," I said.

And we did. The alleys were dirty and filled with the garbage of many years but after the water in the Fends, this did not seem as bad to me. 

"I wish I had my anti-grav belt," I said. "I could get up on the roof."

We listened. There was no sound. It was as if we were the only ones in this part of the city.

Emily Dickinson reached out a hand and touched my hindquarter.

"Did you hear that?" he asked.

I had heard it. It was a Terry sound. Christabel examined it carefully.

"Voices," I said.

"Can you hear what they are saying?" Emily Dickinson asked.

I considered. "It is faint," I said. "I can tell you one of the people speaking is the Czarina."

"That's good," Emily Dickinson said. "It means she is still alive."

We made our way slowly then, trying to get a fix on the sound. It bounced around in these narrow alleyways, but eventually we made our way to the warehouse across from the Library of the Mind, on the other side of Thieves' Alley. I was thinking how aptly named this alleyway was.

We listened.

someone ELSE WAS SPEAKING TO THE czarina."bitch, TELL ME WHERE THAT CAT IS."

"you," Emily SUBVOCALIZED IN MY EAR. "I'm SURE OF IT."

"I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS," THE czarina SAID. "the LAST TIME I SAW IT WAS IN THE crow'S nest. it WALKED OUT AFTER PAYING ON MY TAB."

"you LUSH!" THE OTHER VOICE SAID. "where WAS IT GOING?"

"I DON'T KNOW," THE czarina REPEATED. "Dudley, I KNOW captain star runner, BUT I WOULDN'T CALL US FRIENDS."

"it PAYS YOUR BAR BILLS," THE OTHER VOICE, PRESUMABLY deadly Dudley, SAID. "that SOUNDS FRIENDLY TO ME."

"friendly PERHAPS," THE czarina SAID. "captain star runner USUALLY WANTS INFORMATION AND WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT."

"an UNDERSTANDING," THE VOICE MIMICKED. "you'd SELL YOUR PITIFUL SOUL IF SOMEONE WOULD PAY FOR ANOTHER DRINK. we WENT TO WHERE THE WRETCHED BEAST WAS SQUATTING BUT WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING EXCEPT ITS COMPUTER. the FUCKING PIECE OF CRAP BLEW ITSELF UP."

not EXACTLY, I THOUGHT. it DID NOT EXPLODE. it SIMPLY BECAME UNRECOVERABLE AND UNUSABLE TO THE THIEVES.

the czarina SCREAMED. I TENSED.

"easy," Emily Dickinson MURMURED IN MY EAR. "if WE GO IN HERE WE COULD DO MORE DAMAGE. I NEED TO PROTECT YOU, PUSSY CAT, FROM THESE BASTARDS."

I QUIVERED. Emily Dickinson WAS ADAMANT ABOUT MY SAFETY. I DIRECTED Christabel THAT SURVIVAL AND FREEDOM NEEDED TO BE MY PRIORITY. I BEGAN TO WONDER THAT PROTECTING OTHERS WOULD BE SUBLIMATED, BUT, CONSISTENT WITH MY DIRECTIVE, Christabel SHUT THAT THOUGHT PROCESS DOWN. containing deadly Dudley
became my focus. If this also meant saving the Czarina, so much the better. The reader of this adventure may want to know at this point that despite our genetic engineering and our secondary status within he Race, our survival extinct, especially among star runners, is well-developed. If we save ourselves, we will also save our ships. This can be overridden for the good of the whole, but it must be an override. It is not instinctual.

We waited.

"Where's the fucking cat, Catherine?"

"Look for him, Dudley," the Czarina said. "Please, Dudley, I can't help you. I don't know where you should look. Captain Star Runner doesn't have a ship. It's got to be here in Ptolemy City."

"I'll kill you bitch if you don't tell me something I can use," Deadly Dudley said.

"Find its friends," the Czarina said. "Get your hands off me. Put that knife away, Dudley. You've already cut me with it."

"I'll cut you more if you don't tell me where the wretched beast is," Deadly Dudley shouted.

"Go and look," the Czarina said. "Find its friends."

"What friends?"

"That detective," the Czarina said. "She'll know where it is."

I quivered again. The Czarina meant Detective Roni Camberwell. She was in trouble. I wondered very briefly, before Christabel redirected my attention, how Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and King Richard I--not his real name, of curse--were getting on in their search for Detective Roni Camberwell.

"Jeffrey's got her," Deadly Dudley said
"Maybe she'll talk. As usual, you're worthless. I should just kill you and be done with you for good."

"There's no need for that, Dudley," the Czarina said. I thought there was real fear in her voice but her words were brae enough.

"I'm sick to death of you and your airs," Deadly Dudley went on. "You make me sick."

Silence. We continued to wait, able to see anything or hear anything. There appeared to be no movement. I sniffed the air. Fear, for sure, but the smell of blood had not increased. This was a hopeful development.

"Fuck it!" Deadly Dudley said and started walking toward us.

Emily Dickinson touched me. He began backing up.

Although awkward for me, I did the same. We stepped into the alleyway behind this warehouse, hoping to conceal ourselves. I listened as Deadly Dudley walked out into Thieves' Alley.

Quickly, Emily Dickinson threw open the door and entered, looking about. Only the Czarina was in the cavernous room. It looked like a hanger for large machines.

"Czarina," Emily Dickinson said. "Are you all right?"

"Emily Dickinson," the Czarina said. "Where--"

I entered the room, sniffing.

"Oh, Star, you got my message."

"Sh-h-h," Emily Dickinson said. "We don't want to let them know the pussy cat is here."

"Agreed," the Czarina said.

I saw the blood. She had been cut.

We escorted the Czarina out the way we had come and saw her into a caravan and directed it to take the Czarina for medical attention. That done, we returned to Thieves' Alley.

"Now what?" I asked.

"Let's look about very carefully," Emily Dickinson said. "Neither of us is armed."

"I am," I said.

"You?" Emily Dickinson was astonished.

"Teeth, claws and a very fierce growl," I said. "Also I can pounce."

"these are not mice, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said. "These are men armed with knives and most likely much more powerful weapons."

"I am also AI-assisted," I said. "I can move very fast."

"So can lasers and projectile weapons," Emily Dickinson said. "You're not fighting other cats, pussy cat. You're fighting Terries who won't play fair. They want your hide."

"But not for the nuclear waste project," I said confidently.

"I wouldn't be too certain of that," Emily Dickinson said.

"The Empire still has a price on my head," I said.

"Really?"

"Do not get any ideas, Emily Dickinson," I said.

Emily Dickinson stopped. He turned to me. "Captain Star Runner," he said, "I would not do that to you, even for the reward money and a commission. I'd beg you for funds, first, if I was down to my last deplume."

This was serious talk. Emily Dickinson never called me Captain Star Runner. I bowed. "Thank you," I said. "I am very gratified to hear this. And, yes, if you are down to your last deplume, I will assist you."

"For a price," Emily Dickinson said, and to soften his words, he poked me in the ribs. I have learned this is a positive gesture from Emily Dickinson.

"Very well," I said. "However, I do not know how to find Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo or Detective Roni Camberwell without texting them."

"That would not be wise," Emily Dickinson said.

"I know that," I said. "We would have to go through the library, I think."

"That would be dangerous."

Christabel prompted me. "Unless I check out their security cameras," I said. "They are not all working, of course."

"You can get into their computer?"

"I was in their computer previously when I worked as a night security guard," I explained. "Let me see if Christabel can reestablish the link Oh, connecting, here we are inside. Looking around, now, comparing images, looking for matches."

"Deadly Dudley," I reported, is in the building. He is alone and in the conference room area. No sign of either Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) or Gail Jeffrey's. Scanning. If they are here, they are in an area not covered by the cameras. I'm checking for Stephen Silk, Thunder Bone Bobby, King Richard I, Detective Roni Camberwell and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. Negative inside the building. Checking external security cameras. Negative. Ah, here we are. On the roof."

"What's on the roof?" Emily Dickinson said.

"A vehicle," I said. "It is lifting off. I can see Stephen Silk but no one else--I am not being clear--there are others inside but his is the only clear image."

"Where are they going?" Emily Dickinson asked. "Air space inside the dome is restricted."

"Toward the Ferris Lighthouse spaceport," I said.

"hen let's go," Emily Dickinson said.

We retraced our steps to Market Street and directed a caravan to take us to Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport.

Chapter Twenty-Eight
Trouble at Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport

I do not believe I have described the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport adequately. It is a ground station inside the dome with parking space outside the dome. The shuttles from Alexandria space Station land in the atmosphere of Hypatia and on a landing pad. A mechanical land craft exits the spaceport area which is under the dome and connected a tunnel to go from the shuttle craft's airlock to the spaceport's airlock. In this way passengers can disembark safely. When the passengers disembark, the landing pad is then towed to a parking area.

The air space inside the Ptolemy City dome is restricted. There is little head room. Many buildings are built to nearly touch the dome itself leaving only scant room for repair crews. There is also the concern that vehicles will crash into the dome and cause a breech. As I have previously noted, there are external hatches and small vessels used to come through, but this practice has been eliminated and entry is through the spaceport. Of course, there are freight airlocks as well so that larger items can be offloaded and enter Ptolemy City that way. All of his is necessitated because of the poisonous atmosphere of the planet.

It was anybody's guess where the vehicle would go once it reached Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport. I set Christabel to checking if the spaceport had a landing area.

Because anyone who wants to enter or leave Ptolemy City must process through the spaceport, there is a large area where caravans pick up and discharge passengers. This is the only area Christabel could identify where a vehicle could put down. There was no designated area at the spaceport for such a contingency. Our caravan, therefore, would discharge us in the area we wanted to be.

We arrived after the vehicle had set down, causing great confusion and disruption at the spaceport. We were let out a good distance from the building with general bulletins of "sorry for the inconvenience" and "unforeseen difficulties". We ignored these and looked about. There was no sign of any of the people we were looking for. We hurried inside the spaceport. General bulletins about the disruption to caravan service were being broadcast as well as messages to my communications net now that I was inside the terminal. Christabel sifted these quickly and blocked the repeating messages from my consciousness so that I would not be distracted or irritated. I was grateful for this kind of screening.

The shuttle computer system is quiet secure. It would be difficult to hack. The arrivals and departures would also be difficult to get into. I suspected a private vehicle would be used again. Emily Dickinson agreed with my assessment.

Then a second disaster struck.

"My secure base station is under attack," I reported. "I need to switch to my implant. That will limit us but should protect me from any incursion."

"Fuck," Emily Dickinson said. "Do you think they came here to get at you that way?"

"Perhaps," I said. "They did not wait for me at the apartment."

"True enough," Emily Dickinson said.

I hurried toward the secure lockers. "This is a legal matter," I said. "Someone is interfering with Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport property as well as my own property."

To my amazement, the clerk at the security office did not share my concern.

"Oh," he said, "the directors needed access. They said something dangerous could be stored there. According to your contract, they can open any locker--"

"Hell's bells," Emily Dickinson said. "That is crap. This city is going to hell in a hand basket. Pussy cat, file a complaint with the League of Hypatian Pirates. I'll file one, too. What is Ptolemy City coming to. It's a damn shame."

We hurried away from the security office. I filed the two complaints which prompted a quick and affirmative response from the League of Hypatian Pirates office. They agreed with Emily Dickinson. This was an invasion of privacy. They were sending a team out immediately. My pirate operating insurance came into play. This would not safeguard my base station, but it would pay for its replacement. When we got to the bottom of this matter, it might pay for my other base station as well.

The League of Hypatian Pirates also sent a notice to the Fungusians. That was good. My implant was extremely limited and I needed all my computing power focused on my own internal system and my immediate environment.

A group stood around the locker. I looked them over carefully. There was Stephen Silk and the Terries I had seen with him at the table at the Crow's Nest earlier this evening. Was it still evening? It seemed impossible. Dawn had not ;yet come to Ptolemy City..

"What is the meaning of this?" Emily Dickinson said.

"Security," an officer said.

"In a pig's eye," Emily Dickinson said. "This is private property."

"Not when the security--"

"Stuff it," Emily Dickinson said. "This is an invasion of privacy on the accord between the League of Hypatian Pirate sand the Board of Directors of Hypatia. And you, as  board members, should know that. Captain Star Runner and its property are covered by those accords."

"Captain Star Runner is not a member of the League of Hypatian Pirates," one of the board members responded, "and is not covered on those accords."

"Like hell," Emily Dickinson said. "Captain Star Runner is covered under the "doing business as a pirate" regulations. It pays dues and has been a recognized pirate for a number of years."

"That is correct," a new voice said. The League of Hypatian Pirates representative stepped forward. "This is a show cause and cease and desist  order. You are to stop at once."

Chapter Twenty-Nine
The Ride Begins


Everyone shifted uneasily. A disagreement between the Board of Directors and the League of Hypatian Pirates was a serious matter. Every came to the Pharaoh Star System for profit. , after all, profit was why everyone was here from the tourists at the gambling tables to every worker who stepped off the shuttle at he Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport. No one came to Hypatia to lose money. Everyone wanted to come away from the Pharaoh Star System richer.

Simon Pickford said, "We were unaware Captain Star Runner's property was covered by the Accords."

"In a pig's eye," Emily Dickinson muttered under his breath.

Mikhail Stanneslovsky turned to Stephen Silk. "I think I would be prudent to withdraw."
Stephen Silk opened his mouth to say something, but the words never came.

"Hold it right there, gentlemen," a new voice said. It was King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road--not his real name, of course. "Gentlemen, can I see some identification."

"Who are you," the third man, Mustafa Aziz, demanded.

"Major Richard Whicher, Terran Intelligence," Major Richard Whicher said.

"And what business do you have with us?" Stephen Silk demanded. "I'm a citizen of the Alliance."

"The Alliance has documents of understanding between Terran Intelligence and its Ministry of Defense," Major Richard Whicher said. "Identification, please."

Grudgingly, the Terries showed him their identification. His claim to be Terran Intelligence was accepted without question. This surprised me. I hoped I would be able to ask why later. I went to make a note, hesitated. My implant had limited storage capability.

"It is all right," CChristabel said. "This base unit is undamaged. It is running in a very secure mode, but I can make a note for you to follow up. I have no data about the working relationship between the Board of Directors of Hypatia, Inc. and Terran Intelligence. I myself would be very interested to know."

I knew CChristabel meant the Fungusians would be interested.


"Mr. Silk," Major Whicher said, "what is your interest in Captain Star Runner. I can understand the Board of Directors being concerned for the safety of this spaceport in particular and Ptolemy City in general. You, however, have no direct interest in these matters."

"He reported the breach to us," Mustafa Aziz said quickly.

"And how would you know?" Major Richard Which asked Stephen Silk.

"I was told," Stephen Silk said. Now that he did not hold the upper hand, he seemed very uncomfortable.

"By whom?" Major Richard Whicher said.

"By interested parties," Stephen Silk said.

"Stephen, that is enough," another new voice said. Gail Jeffrey's stepped forward, a lazier pistol in her hand. She pointed it at Major Richard Whicher.

"No more questions," Gail Jeffrey's said. "Stephen, come with me. I believe these gentlemen can resolve their differences without you."

Stephen Silk nodded. "Put the pistol away, Gail," he said. "I'll go with. Leave this Whicher character to play identification games with the Board."

"Let's go," Gail Jeffrey's said.

I wondered that no one reached for their com units. 

"Pistols are legal in the spaceport," Emily Dickinson murmured in my ear. "They cannot detain her for even pointing it at someone or using it to escort someone out of the terminal."

I do not carry arms so the finer points of Hypatian conduct concerning weapons are unknown to me. CChristabel wrote another note to follow up on this. Living planet side did seem to have a number of drawbacks. I so wished I had my ship.

After Gail Jeffrey's and Stephen Silk had left, Simon Pickford asked Major Richard Whicher, "What is your interest here?"

"What is your interest in Landscape of Thorns?" Major Richard Whicher asked, including the representative from the League of Hypatian Pirates.

"We have no official position," the representative said.

"And the Board of Directors of Hypatia, Inc.?" Major Richard Whicher asked.

"We do not support the trafficking of sentient beings," Mikhail Stanneslovsky said.

"And the Pirates?" Major Richard Whicher asked.

"We would also oppose such an activity," the representative said, "officially. The most we could do is censure any member who participated in such an activity."

"And that is your concern here?" Mustafa Aziz asked.

"Yes," Major Richard Whicher said. "The Solar League is very concerned that Panthera will take steps to defend its androgens against such trafficking. The Pantherans may not discriminate among the different Terran groups. They have not been particular in the past. That is also the Alliance's concern--beyond the sentient being rights question." Major Richard Whicher nodded in my direction.
 "We recognize the high profile position Captain Star Runner holds as both an androgen and an associate of the League of Hypatian Pirates."

"Yes," Simon Pickford said. I could tell he was not pleased with my position.

"And you are here because," Mustafa Aziz asked.

"Gathering intelligence," Major Richard Whicher said and smiled.

Turning to Emily Dickinson and me he said, "If you could accompany me?"

When we were out of earshot he said, "Is everything in order, Captain Star Runner?"

"It appears to be," I said. "of course, I'm operating in a very secure mode which means not all functions are available at this time."

"Understood," Major Richard Whicher said.

"Where's Gyllie?" Emily Dickinson interrupted.

"And Detective Roni Camberwell," I added.

"We need to pick them up," Major Richard Whicher said. "I need to get my ship powered up. We need to get off planet temporarily, at least."

I was uneasy. This would mean leaving my base station behind and relying on my implant when out-of-range. How long? How far?

"this way," Major Richard Whicher said cheerfully. 

We followed.

Major Richard Whicher's ship was an old training vessel. We climbed aboard.

"Captain Star Runner, can you start its blastoff count down?" Major Richard Whicher asked.

"Certainly," I said. It meant looking at gauges and displays outside of my brain, but I could operate a Terry ship this way. I doubted Major Richard Whicher would let me fly the machine. I was simply doing he pre launch checklist. He left the vessel.

He returned quickly "They're in trouble," he said without preamble. "I thought I had left Gyllie and Roni in a safe location, but Zoe or Zora or whoever she is has located them and has a weapon on them. Are we ready to go, Captain?"

I looked over the controls. "In ten," I said, beginning the countdown. Major Richard Whicher slid into the command seat. "Fasten your seat belts," he said cheerily. "We're going to see how flying in Ptolemy City is done."

I was shocked. It was true our ship was inside the dome and on a temporary launch pad module, but a liftoff inside a dome was a trickery maneuver. Nevertheless, Major Richard Whicher began the sequence to gently lift us off the pad, not exactly a blastoff, but a gentle rising action.

I sat still, observing. Major Richard Whicher was a professional. I could learn from him.

He took the ship up and banked heading in the direction of the Library of the Mind. "Captain Star Runner," Major Richard Whicher said, is the roof stable enough to land this bird?"

I knew Terries often referred to vehicles that moved in air as birds. "There is a landing pad," I said.

"And access to the building from the roof?"

"There is a freight entry point," I said. "There is also an individual jump tube."

"That will do very nicely," Major Richard Whicher said.

In no time at all he set the craft down on the roof and jumped out. We followed.

"If you will stay with the craft," Major Richard Whicher said, "I believe I will attempt the rescue. "Captain Star Runner, your com frequency."

I relayed the information.

"Excellent." And the former King Richard I of the Gloucester Road descended out of site into the jump tube.

"Damn," Emily Dickinson said. "This is quite a development. I wonder how long his undercover operation has been going on."

"For some time if the condition of his cabin is any indication," I said. "It looked quite well appointed."

I had the security cameras in view. We were fine on the roof. My interior view did not show me any of the principles, either Gail Jeffrey's, Stephen Silk, Deadly Dudley, Thunder Bone Bobby or Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe). I could not located any of our people either. Major Richard Whicher was off the grid as well as Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and Detective Roni Camberwell. I became very anxious, prowling about the roof, looking in all directions.

Then two things happened, almost at once.

King Richard I, I mean Major Richard Whicher, returned with Detective Roni Camberwell and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo came through the jump tube and made their way to the vessel.

A second ship landed on the warehouse on the other side of Thieves' Alley, the same warehouse where Emily Dickinson and I had found the Czarina with Deadly Dudley. It opened its hatch. Several figures darted across the roof into the hatch. It closed. Then a large weapon swiveled in our direction.

Chapter Thirty
I Find An Old Friend

King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, waved his stick at us. "Hurry," he shouted. "We don't have much time."

Gone from his expression was any of the famed madness I had previously observed. We boarded the small spacecraft, Detective Roni Camberwell, Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and Emily Dickinson climbed aboard. The spacecraft was very old,oddly shaped but it was our best hope.


"Fasten your seat belts," King Richard I, or should I say, Richard Whicher, ordered. The Terries did. I sat up front in what I judged to be the co-pilot's seat. It had the most room after the pilot's seat. I was cramped. Terry seats do not fit me well at all. I did not bother with the seat belt. It would never fit me properly. They never did.

Something niggled at the back of my mind. The shape of this ship. It was not a Terry spacecraft. it belonged to my race. What was it doing way out here in Hypatian space?

I studied the floor boards. Was the AI still underneath? 
, Whicher scanned his controls and found the one he wanted. We lifted off and headed toward the hatch in the dome I had spotted from the Library of the Mind's roof my first evening on the job.

We moved toward the hatch. Richard Whicher found the control to begin the airlock to open. We moved inside. The hatch closed.

"Nothing like being sitting ducks," Emily Dickinson said.

"Eberhardt," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We were sitting ducks back there."

"What are we waiting for?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"For the air, the Ptolemy City air, to be pumped out of the chamber and for the hatch to the outside to be opened. The pressure has to be equalized," Richard Whicher said.

The Hypatian air surrounded us. We could feel it pressing in on the little ship. Then the outer hatch swung open and we were outside.
 
This was a training vessel. I had learned to be a star runner on a craft like this 
My brain finally registered this. No AI ever 
 attempted to remove these old memories for extra storage space. It was so a part of my mind I would have experienced a brain disruption should it be deleted. I am certain it was always a part of my regular backup. it had lain dormant until this little ship reminded me--

All my memories came into focus, grudgingly, 
but they came. I looked at the floorboards. I needed an interface. The indentations in each strip were for Pantheran paws . I leaned down and started pulling up the decking.  
I needed the training vessel's AI.


'What are you doing, Star?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Trying to save us," I said.

I put my paw inside a compartment. The cables were there. I started pulling them out. They fed nicely into CChristabel's ports. It would be a bit awkward, but it would work.

The little ship trembled. The winds were high. The snow swirled about us, red and green and blue. We could be thankful that on visual scan, we would be next to impossible to find. We had no way of knowing what kind of equipment was on the other ship.
They had not come through the hatch yet.
I snapped the last cable into place. Was the AI still active.

"Identify yourself," a voice said in my head in my own language.

Without thinking, I responded with my identification number.

"Confirmed," the voice said.

"I'm taking control," I said out loud for the Terries to hear.

"You can't," Richard Whicher gasped. "They're going to come through that hatch any minute now."

"I know," I said. I had a three hundred and sixty degree view in three dimensions. We were about to be in very big trouble.

I was not in an acceleration web. I did not have any supports, any intravenous drips, any protection. I was flying, as the Terries like to say, by the seat of my pants though I had none and never have had any pants.

"Welcome back," the ship's AI said.

CChristabel questioned, but I knew.

"My training ship," I said. "This is my training ship from the Institute.

"What's going on, pussy cat?" Emily Dickinson yelled above the storm outside.

"It's my old ship from the Institute," I yelled back. "We're getting reacquainted."

"Great," Richard Whicher groaned. "Old home week."

"This ship knows me," I said. "It's a star runner ship and we are going to give those Terries a hell of a chase." 
It was good to be one with a ship again," even this ship.
Lives were at stake. It was our mission to bring our passengers safely to port--any port.




I fed the external data the AI needed to understand we were being set up by an armed and dangerous second spacecraft. We could not outrun them. We could not turn and fight.  The other ship burst through the hatch behind us. It was newer, faster and was armed.

The AI understood the mission. It would be difficult to say if the AI understood this was very real, not a simulation. Our lives were truly at stake. CChristabel knew it and was making connections to the rudimentary AI of the ship.

"Safeties off," I said. "We're flying hot, hot hot."

"You always did," the AI said.

"We're flying close to the edge," I said. "Head for the volcano, oblique approach, fastest speed, as low as you can go."

The training ships could fly very, very low. It was one of our most difficult tests, to fly almost touching a space station, avoiding protrusions, aerials, vents, booms, docking stations, other space vehicles, slow moving barges, space suited workers. It we touched, we were marked down. If we gave too much room, we were marked down. We went low and fast. I was gambling the other ship could not overtake us and shoot down on us. Their cannons were not angled in that direction. I wanted to get them over the lava flows, in the winds from the volcano, near the heat and the distortions of color. I wanted to frighten them as well as confuse them. I was flying entirely by sensors, sensors, I noted, which still worked flawlessly.

"I don't understand," Richard Whicher said, hitting his controls. "The ship is not responding to me."
Star's got it," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

Detective Roni Camberwell held tightly to her armrests. She had rarely been off the ground and never in a craft like this.


"Is this the way to the station?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo shouted.

"	No," I called back to her. "We're going to the Pyramid Volcano."

"Why are we going to a fucking volcano?" Emily Dickinson yelled.

"To lose some terries," I yelled back.

Then Richard Whicher laughed. It was like his insane King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road laugh. "Going to cook some goose, Captain Star Runner?"

"Yes," I said. "I hope to do just that."

"Hold on," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "This ship and Star can handle higher Gs than we can."

We were accelerating fast, hugging the Hypatian terrain. We were veering in the wind, but we were making a long arc which would in compass both the long lava flow with its steam and the volcano itself. I set CChristabel to calculate how close to the erupting top we could go. She got the little ship's specs and provided a general map of the area to the training vessel.

Gail Jeffrey's crew was in pursuit. They fired, but we were far enough ahead of them and the winds were strong enough that the cannon fire was useless against us. 

CChristabel fed our relative positions and the map onto the display screen for everyone else to see. The AI and I worked flawlessly together to keep the ship on course and stable. If I was in an acceleration web, strapped down, this would not have been necessary, but as I had no web and my passengers only had flimsy belts, I needed to be diligent.

We got behind the lava flow. The AI had chartered a course to miss the worst of the steam. Now we followed the lava back toward the volcano.

"Assuming we survive the volcano," Richard Whicher said, "where do we go from there.

"Over the South Pole," I said. "I believe there is an estate just beyond it."

"Stephanie's old place," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo gasped.

"Indeed," I said. 

"Do you think it is still viable?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"Yes," I said. "I set the controls, correct?"

"It would have been you," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "I was dealing with Stephanie's."

"Who are we talking about?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"You remember the Contessa, don't you?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "she is Phani's mother."

"And Trenton, NJ," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"Exactly," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"Who are these people?" Richard Whicher asked.

"Another adventure," Emily Dickinson said. "But she has this castle over the South Pole. The pussy cat has a good idea. We get in there, it is defendable and we can probably call for help from there."

We were climbing up the side of the volcano. The trajectory calculations running were intense. The winds grew stronger. Our ride got bumpier. I laid down on the floor in the aisle. I banged against every seat and slid around. There was no help for it. But I could feel the ship and we were one. Gail Jeffrey's and her crew and hostages followed us doggedly.

We came nearer and near the cater. We began skimming the edge, going lower, getting closer. The temperature climbed. The decking seemed to grow hot. I was having trouble breathing. We were continuing to accelerate. I could see the terries were experiencing extreme G forces. We dived. We came up sharply. We were out on the other side of the volcano. I could detect no other ship. I slowed us down. Leveled off. Made a gradual descent down the other side of the volcano.

"Are they gone?" Detective Roni Camberwell whispered.

"I think so," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said quietly. 

"I couldn't see much," Richard Whicher said to me. "That was some very fancy flying on your part, Captain Star Runner."

"You okay,pussy cat?" Emily Dickinson said.

"I'm banged up," I said. "I'll need some recovery time if we can set down at the Contessa's castle."

As I had hoped, the castle was in tact and I was able to set us down there.

Chapter QQQ

Emily Dickinson scrambled out with Detective Roni  Camberwell. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo leaned over and spoke to Richard Whicher.  I started to get up.

"Star," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "Have you unlocked the castle?"

"I cannot do it remotely," I said. "I have to go to the door. It needs my voice print."

"Can you walk?"

"Yes, I think so," I said.

"then do that now," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Then, if you are able, we need to go back right away."

"Back?" I queried.

"We need to find that other ship," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"Why?" I asked.

"Because we need to rescue any survivors or determine exactly what happened?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"Why?" I repeated.

"Call it a Terry thing," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We don't leave people out in a hostile environment to die of exposure even if they are our enemies. We call doing that inhuman."

I went to say something, then thought better of it. What I would have said Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo would have characterized as inhuman. After all, that is what I am, inhuman.

I stiffly got to my feet and painfully got out of the ship. I padded carefully over to the castle door where Emily Dickinson and Detective Roni Camberwell waited. I opened the door.

The butler appeared, a very clever robot as I remembered.

"May I help you?" he asked. "The Contessa is not in."

"Well, we're here," Emily Dickinson said. "We're coming in."

"I do not believe--" the butler began.

"It is all right," I said. "The Contessa authorized me to act for her, you remember?"

"Of course, Captain Star Runner." he butler said.

"Give these people whatever they require," I said. "I need to go out again. I'll be back, possibly with some others. Carry on."

"Very well, 'Captain Star Runner," the butler said. And to Emily Dickinson and Detective Roni Camberwell, "please come this way. It will take a few moments for me to awaken my staff."

"I hope the steaks are still good," Emily Dickinson said.

"The freezers were excellent and well-stocked," I said. "I'll interface with the butler when I return to straighten out any problems."

"Where are you going?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"To look for survivors," I said. "Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo idea."

"I should go with you," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"I think you've had enough flying," Emily Dickinson said, taking her arm. "Come with me. We need to get this place ready for any guests Gyllie and Ritchie may turn up."

I noticed he did not include me. I suppose my disinterest in survivors was clear.

I returned to the ship. Oh, for an acceleration web or even my basket. I was not at all accustomed to feeling so much pain with no relief in sight.

"I known you are uncomfortable," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo when I 
re boarded the training craft. "We will do what we can when we return. For now, it is best if you retrace our route so we can find the other ship."

I interfaced with the train ship's AI. We lifted off and began flying back toward Pyramid Volcano.

I displayed our original route in blue on the display screen and our return flight in green. I placed an orange marker at the place I thought the other ship had disappeared.

"They would not have survived if they crashed," I said. "No one can breathe this atmosphere or withstand these temperatures."

"We need to be certain," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"And we need to confirm who was aboard that ship," Major Richard Whicher said.

"I do not understand," I said, making some minute corrections on our flight plan, "where the Board of Directors of Hypatia, Inc. fit into this."

"My investigations," Major Richard Whicher said, "suggest that the Board of Directors as a whole are not involved with the Landscape of Thorns. I believe it is only the three we saw."

"Fill me in, Richie," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"We found Stephen Silk, Mustafa Aziz, Mikhail Stanneslovsky and Simon Pickford opening Captain Star Runner's secure locker where its base station is kept. They were claiming a security threat to the spaceport."

"How did you stop them?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"Captain Star Runner notified the League of Hypatian Pirates," Major Richard Whicher explained. "As a member of the League, Captain Star Runner's rights are protected."

"I am not a member of the League of Hypatian Pirates," I correct Major Richard Whicher. "I am covered under the "doing business as" clause."

"It amounts to the same thing," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "You would be a member in full, Star, if they did not have that clause about being Terran."

I was unsure about this but the point to be argued was mute. I need to concentrate on my flying. The wind sheers were difficult enough. We were getting much closer to the crater of Pyramid Volcano.

		

"I will be unable to use heat signatures," I said. "I do not have life sign sensors."

"Check for Terran metals," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Do you have them?"

"Configuring," I said. "The Terry enhancements to the ship will be applicable."

"How did you come by this ship?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked Major Richard Whicher.

"It was available in system when I got off at the mining facility," Major Richard Whicher said. "I don't know its provenance."

"It was my training vessel back at the Institute," I said. "I wonder how it ended up in the Pharaoh Star System being used by Terries."

"Maybe it can tell you," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo suggested.

"Negative,' I said. "It was not connected to many of the enhancements, but with my implant and reading Major Richard Whicher's display, we are making do to locate the ship."

We made our way around the erupting center of the volcano. There were no indications any ship had passed this way.

"Our last visual of the pursuing ship was here," I announced. "I cannot take us near the center of the creator. I can do a search pattern."

"Proceed," Major Richard Whicher said, studying his controls. I'll see if I can spot anything while you fly this bird."

It was a long and frustrating procedure. We finally worked out way clear of the volcano with no results.

"Now what?" I asked.

"Is it possible, Richie, that they would have flown back to Ptolemy City?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"If they couldn't follow us, that would make sense," Major Richard Whicher said. "In that case, we have several courses of action."

'Which are?" I asked.

"Go back to the spaceport," Major Richard Whicher said, "and pursue our investigations--"

"Or go directly to the Library of the Mind," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "and see if they re-entered there--"

"Or return to the Contessa's castle," I suggested.

"My concern is that they will have left the planet," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"We could follow them," I said.

"We're not provisioned to do that with this ship, Star," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "It's only an interplanetary craft."

I considered this. "Perhaps," I said.

"Sometimes there were provisions to go out of the star system with these training vessels. I would need more time to investigate its potential."

"If they have left the system,"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "we would be some time behind them. I don't want to abandon Eberhardt and the detective at the Contessa's castle."

"Then shall we return there?' I asked.

"That seems reasonable," Major Richard Whicher said. "We will reassess our options there. It has been some time since any of us slept."

I plotted a new course and returned us to the Contessa's castle.

Emily Dickinson said to me, �has an idea. Would you all like to hear it before you get some shut eye?�

�Yes,� I said, hoping to have some time with Detective Roni Camberwell. �We may also be able to share some information with Detective Roni Camberwell.�



Emily Dickinson had been busy. There was a spread of food from the Contessa�s castle larder. My implant--I was too far from the base station--directed me to the better food choices. I needed to be careful of my system. I had been separated from any direct connection to my base station for more than a standard day.


�The police force in Ptolemy City,� Detective Roni Camberwell explained, �has been aware for some time that there is a split in the Board of Directors of Hypatia, Inc. One group has insisted that the corporation maintain its original purpose to develop Ptolemy City and the Alexandria Space Station as a free port, a tourist attraction, gambling, prostitution and a meeting place where deals can be done. Another portion of the board of directors wants to change the character of both the space station and the city, to become more of an oligarchy with lots of restrictions and more invasive regulations so that there is more control about who and what comes in and out of the system.�

�Would Simon Pickford, Mustafa Aziz and Mikhail Stanneslovsky be part of this group?� Major Richard Whicher asked.

�They are this group,� Detective Roni Camberwell said. 
�We have been hearing that they planned a take over of he Board of Directors.�

�Would the folks at the Library of the Mind have anything to do with this?� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

�it would seem they are connected if what the three of us encountered at the spaceport,� Emily Dickinson said. �Perhaps Gail Jeffrey intervention was to disrupt the confrontation between those three and the League of Hypatian Pirates. By definition, the Pirates would not want more control. They have always wanted less control.�

�Where do Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby and I fit into this picture,� I asked.

�And the Landscape of Thorns,� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo added.


�So perhaps,� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, �they all are connected to the Landscape of Thorns, including the board members.�

�What is the Landscape of Thorns?� Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo explained.

�yes,� Detective Roni Camberwell said. �
 
�Okay,� Emily Dickinson said. �We have a connection to the three rogue board members and Stephen Silk. We have a connection between Stephen Silk and Gail Jeffrey's. We have a connection between Deadly Dudley, Thunder Bone Bobby and the Czarina asking questions about the pussy cat.�

�We have the questions they were asking me,� Detective Roni Camberwell said. �I went to the Library of the Mind because I was trailing Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby. They are connected to at least the Zora/Zoe  woman, whoever she might be.�

�And she seems to be connected with both Gail Jeffrey's and Stephen Silk,� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

�And the two pirates,� Major Richard Whicher said, �are part of the Landscape of Thorns.�The police force has heard rumors about a special project between the Pharaoh Star System and the Eastern Gate. We knew some ships were being diverted and then would reappear, sans their cargos and passengers. It is very possible some Terrans have been taken there but more likely it is the androgens you speak of and cargo. The cargo is either for the reclamation project or used to get money for it.�

�If the Board members are involved,� Major Richard Whicher said, �they certainly want to control who knows about their venture so that they can keep profits for themselves. I�ve heard the mining operation on Mark Antony is in trouble. If they were heavily invested there, they are looking for a way to reverse their financial fortunes.�

�Where does this leave us?� Detective Roni Camberwell said. �We need a plan of action.�

�I need to check on my base station,� I said, �and recharge. I have done about all I can do without receiving some care. Major Richard Whicher can fly the ship back to the spaceport. With some adjustments, the AI aboard his ship and my base station can direct the construction of a basket or web for me. I might be safest on the ship if Major Richard Whicher will allow it.�

�Certainly,� Major Richard Whicher said. �You did some fancy flying there, Star Runner. I�ve heard of what star runners can do, but I�ve never seen it in action. You had a jury rigged system and you were excellent. We might not have survived if you hadn�t been at the helm.�

�Thank you,� I said, not too humbly. I am an excellent star runner. In my opinion, there is not one better.

Chapter Thirty-One
We Return to Ptolemy City

I again secured the Contessa�s castle. After having completed that chore, we re boarded the training vessel. I released all control of the ship to Major Richard Whicher and sagged into my seat. Our return was much more leisurely though I slept a good part of the trip. 

�Wait here,� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo told me. �We�ll check on your base station and see what we can learn. Will your base station allow me to touch it?�

�Yes,� I said. �I�m in contact with it and have given the necessary instructions.�

�OK,� Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. �You rest. We�ll have you set up as quickly as we can.�

I do not remember a great deal of the next twenty-four hours. I primitive acceleration web was installed and my base station moved to the training vessel. The others got some sleep. Detective Roni Camberwell checked in at the police station. There was no sign of any of the others, Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffrey's, Zora O�Neill Eisenhower (Zoe), Deadly Dudley, Thunder Bone Bobby, Simon Pickford, Mikhail Stanneslovsky or Mustafa Aziz. When I was again conscious, the team had gathered including a new member, the Czarina.

�I want Dudley stopped,� the Czarina told me. �I�m coming along to help you.�

By then, too, a plan had been devised. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo explained it to me.

"We have no word on the individuals in question," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We'll go to the space station and see what we can learn there. If they're not here, they probably went there first and may still be there unless they have left the system."

"I have cleared Emily Dickinson to go with us," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "Major Whicher and Captain Romeres Lujo were helpful in commuting his sentence. I have authority to question everyone on the space station."

"I initiated proceedings on your behalf, pussy cat, at the League of Hypatian Pirates against Stephen Silk and those three board members," Emily Dickinson said. "I can act on your behalf should the need arise."

Interesting. Emily Dickinson is a professional assassin. I now had a contract out on those four persons should it become necessary to activate it. I had never been in this position previously.

"And you can pilot us up to the space station," Major Richard Whicher said. "Are you up to that, Star Runner?"

"Yes," I said. "I wondered at his use of "star runner". It did not sound so much like my name as it sounded like a designation. Well, it was my designation. Properly speaking, I do not have a name."

I logged into the 
training vessel's AI.

"Leave when ready," Major Richard Whicher instructed me as  everyone strapped in.

I made contact with planet control. "We are preparing to leave Hypatia," I said. "We will stay clear of standard shuttle routes."

"Confirmed," Planet Control said at the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport said. "Do you require any additional assistance?"

"Negative," I said. "I am capable us making planetary escape velocity independent."

"As you wish," Planet Control said and signed off. No flight plan is necessary. When we cleared the atmosphere, I would notify the Alexandria Space Station of our imminent arrival.

We lifted into the clouds. I interfaced with the training vessel AI. We were shortly establishing an orbit around Hypatia. I got my bearings and maneuvered to reach Over the Moon Freight docks on the space station. I had docking privileges there and we need not pay the exorbitant fees at the passenger terminal. Besides, I doubted Deadly Dudley had. I circled the space station in case any vessel caught our attention. None did though there was a very fancy yacht docked there and a luxury liner was on final approach.

The training vessel handled smoothly. Our approach to Dock seventeen went smooth. The docking clamps clanked into place. We heard them inside the spaceship. We received the go ahead to open our door to the cargo dock.


"Major Richard Whicher and I will go to the passenger area," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "We'll look for the missing board directors. They are likely to get aboard a passenger liner or yacht leaving the star system as soon as possible. We'll also check in with the station manager."

"Emily Dickinson and I will go through the spacer areas," I said. "We're bound to find Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby there. Detective Roni Camberwell, do we know what sort of ship they have?" I asked.

"I don't have that info," Detective Roni Camberwell said, "otherwise we could check with the station. "The Czarina and I will check through the upper levels here and on the other side of the station. Maybe someone is having a fancy meal."

We split up then, making our way out of the cold docking area into the relative warmth of the Alexandria Space Station.

The corridors in the spacer area were narrow and smelled of sweat, dirty bodies and alcohol with an overlay of bacon grease and cabbage. We went to bars, looking, asking, looking again. I felt a pang as we went pass what had been Gwen Chen's restaurant. I had had many good meals there. I had thought Gwen Chen was my friend. Perhaps she was. What I had learned about her was as not pleasant. I felt wistful. I had liked Gwen Chen. I did not like what I had learned about her and how her death had threatened my own life. We found no sign of Deadly Dudley or Thunder Bone Bobby. I wondered if the others were doing any better. I wondered if we were searching for a needle in a haystack. I wondered what a haystack was. I did not send out a query to answer my question. It probably was an archaic term. Many of the Terry expressions I knew were nonsensical, harking back to a much earlier time on Earth.

At last we wearily made our way down a grimy corridor which looked like so many others we had visited already. The sign on the door of the dingy greasy spoon said "The Cow."

"How original," Emily Dickinson said. "I doubt this is a steakhouse."

"It looks more down-and-out than most of the other places," I said. "This almost seems like an unused area of the Alexandria Space Station. Is it even open?"

"It appears so," Emily Dickinson said, pushing open the door.

There were only a few tables along one wall. The establishment was poorly light. Half the light fixtures were dark. half of the lighted ones flickered. We surveyed the tables. All were empty. All were dirty. No joy here.

We were about to leave when a tired woman came through the swinging doors at the far end of the restaurant. "What can I get you space rats?" the woman asked.


"Some information," I said. "We are looking for two people. We wonder if they were in here earlier."

"If your friends are the two space rats they didn't pay for their grub," the woman said, "I'd be much obliged if you paid their bill."

"Were they Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby?" I asked.

"You that Pantheran everybody's always talking about?" the woman asked me.

"I do not know," I said. "I come into this spaceport regularly. I lost my ship in the explosion several weeks ago."

"You'd be the one," the woman said. "I hear you like people food."

"I do," I said.

"We got some good grub here," the woman said. "I'll get you some." Turning to Emily Dickinson she said, "What can I get you?"

Emily Dickinson hesitated. He fancies himself a particular eater.

"eggs," Emily Dickinson said, "over light with American fries and sausage."

"Links or patties?" the woman asked.

"Patties," Emily Dickinson said.

"I like your dress," the woman said.

"Thank you," Emily Dickinson said.

We remained standing. We were uncertain about the tables. I was uncertain about the floor.

The woman retreated to behind the swinging door but came back almost immediately with a wet cloth. She not only wiped a table for us, she wiped the booth for Emily Dickinson and a place on the floor for me. The woman piled the dirty dishes on another table.

"Thank you," I said. "Where is your thumb pad? I will pay for the meals the other two ate."

The woman reached into her apron pocket and withdrew a much battered thumb pad. She showed me the order. It was a lot of food but the prices were very inexpensive. I wondered that Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby had not paid. I thumbed the entry and added a regulation tip. The woman nodded, then returned the pad to her pocket.

"I've heard you pay fair," the woman said to me.

"You work for a living just like I do," I said.

I wondered about our food. The woman's apron was worn and dirty. Her hair was greasy and she looked very tired.

When the food came, it was both plentiful and quite good. The appearance of the restaurant suggested the food would also be grimy and poorly prepared. Emily Dickinson ate his meal quickly, but he savored his coffee. I suppose eating pre-packaged meals in his incarceration cabin made his taste in food change.

The woman brought me steamed sourdough bread with five-spice hummus and sauerkraut. It was quite good. I ate all four slices.

The woman stood and watched us, saying nothing. She slumped. I wondered that she did not sit down or return to the kitchen. When we were finished, the woman offered me the payment pad again. Again I paid and tipped her appropriately.

"Now Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby," I said.

"They ate," the woman said "and then they left without paying."

"Did they say anything you overheard that might tell us where they were going or what their plans might be?" I asked.

The woman frowned. "Let me see," she said. "One of them was angry. He kept dressing the other one. The other one kept saying, "It's not my fault. You talked to them. I didn't do nothing.""

"That would be Thunder Bone Bobby," I said, "the one that kept saying he did not do anything."

"That's right," the woman said. "The other one called him Bobby."

"And what was that one saying Bobby did wrong?" Emily Dickinson asked.

Ca, something well."

"Camberwell?" I asked.

"That's it," the woman said. "They did not get the information from Camberwell. Bobby said he wanted to kill her but the other one said they needed information."

"Information about what?"

"About someone named Star, Captain Star," the woman said.

"Captain Star Runner," I said.

"That's it. They needed information about Captain Star Runner, but Camberwell didn't know."

"That is very helpful," I said. "Did you hear them say where they were going?"

"To find someone named Stephen," the woman said. "Stephen had to pay them."

"Thank you," I said, getting up. "You have been very helpful."

We left The Cow then. The woman continued to stand where we left her, still frowning. It was a very sad restaurant though the food was surprisingly good. I wondered how strange it was.

Emily Dickinson and I made our way back toward the dock, our agreed upon rendezvous point. We still did not know where Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby were, but we knew that I was one of their foci and that Stephen Silk was their contact. None of what was going on made any sense to me.

"I do not understand much of this," I said.

"You seem to be important to this operation," Emily Dickinson said "though I can't understand why either. It does make me very concerned for your well-being, pussy cat. No one has been following us, but I'm glad I'm keeping an eye on you."

We stepped out onto the docks. We had to walk out onto the peer. There were ships birthed on either side of us and space rats coming and going. The dock was busy.


We saw Major Richard Whicher standing in front of our vessel. I wondered that he had not gone inside. As we approached, Major Richard Whicher stepped close to me, lifting his weapon.

"Step away, Dickinson," Major Richard Whicher said. "the star runner is coming with me."

"Not a chance," Emily Dickinson said.

"I said, step away," Major Richard Whicher said. "the star runner is my property."

"No way," Emily Dickinson said and shot Major Richard Whicher.

It was that simple. Though Major Richard Which had a weapon, he never fired. He simply sank to the dock dead. Emily Dickinson re-holstered his own weapon. I had never seen him draw it. It fit snugly in his hand. I wondered if he had been carrying it there for some time.

This happened very quickly.

"I wonder," I said, looking at the dead major Richard Whicher beside me, "what this means."

"I believe," Emily Dickinson said, "that King Richard I, Duke of the Gloucester Road, was either an impostor or had his own agenda. Either way, he cannot kidnap you or be a threat to you anymore
."

"What happened to Major Richard Whicher?" Detective Roni Camberwell said, panting, after having run across the dock. "I saw him collapse as I was coming out onto the peer."

"I shot him," Emily Dickinson said. "It's not a crime, detective. Major Richard Whicher was trying to kidnap Captain Star Runner. I simply prevented him from doing so. My professional services are listed at the League of Hypatian Pirates as protecting the pussy cat here."

"Yes, I know," Detective Roni Camberwell said, "but he was trying to kidnap Star? Why?"

"The why remains to be seen," Emily Dickinson said. "He seemed to think the pussy cat was his property. Kept referring to it as simply 'the star runner'."

"How very strange," Detective Roni Camberwell said, staring at the dead major Richard Whicher. "I suppose I ought to check his pockets."

Detective Roni Camberwell did just that. There was the usual sort of Terry detritus. Opening Major Richard Whicher's wallet, Detective Roni Camberwell whistled. 

"What?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"He has a microchip here," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "It's for a Pantheran security sweep."

"I have one imbedded in my ear," I said. "It would be interesting to know what it says. I am sure the AI on the training vessel could tell Camberwell stopped me.

"Stay here," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I will go inside and remove you base station, Star. I do not want you going into that ship. Major Richard Whicher, or whoever he really is, wanted to kidnap you. Perhaps the AI aboard the ship knows this."

"Good idea," I said, ashamed I had not thought of it. I always think shipboard AI's are my friends. And perhaps my own training ship AI still was. It was hard to know. Then again, perhaps this was not my old training vessel or even the AI. Terries are clever. They pretend about so many things. It could have all been made to seem so to me so that I would trust the AI aboard this ship and Major Richard Whicher, too. I was very quiet.

"You are brooding, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said. "What is it?"

"I am too trusting," I said.

"You are designed to trust AI's," Emily Dickinson said. It was as if he could read my mind. Then again, maybe my mind was so simple that any Terry could read it.

"Here you are," Detective Roni Camberwell said, setting my base station down in front of me. "I had no problem removing it. I was surprised. I thought CChristabel, that's her name, isn't it?, would object."

"I trust you," I said. "I told CChristabel that."

"Oh," Detective Roni Camberwell said and turned a reddish color. "Well, here she is. I asked the shipboard AI about Major Richard Whicher and the micro card. According to that AI, Major Richard Whicher is a class two informant for the Pantheran Empire. It did not know what Class Two meant."

"It means he is fairly low level," Emily Dickinson said. "It means the Pantherans may want his information but they do not share a lot of information with him."

"One mystery solved," I said bitterly. "Does that bring us any closer to solving what is going on?"


"That perhaps Major Richard Whicher was a double agent," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "I think we need to check on he others. I have sent a message to station security to deal with Major Whicher's body and to hold it for me."

As we started back down the peer, all the space rats seemed agitated. They were pointing me out to each other.

"What is it?" Detective Roni Camberwell demanded of one particularly belligerent spacer.

"It brought the warships here," he said.

"What warships?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"The three Pantheran warships that entered the system about an hour ago," he said.

The three of us exchanged looks. This was unprecedented.

"I'm taken this Pantheran to the station manager for interrogation," Detective Roni Camberwell said as other space rats started moving in our direction. "Dickinson, hold a weapon on this prisoner"Yes, ma'am," Emily Dickinson said, cocking his hand as if he was holding a weapon. I saw no weapon. I wondered if it was still in its holster or whether it was ready to protect me from the growing crowd.

So I was marched to the station manager's office with a variety of spacers following at a discrete distance.


We found an image of the Pantheran warships on the station manager's wall-sized display screen and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and the Czarina in his office.

Chapter Thirty-Three
The End of the Matter and A New Beginning

"What do they want?" Emily Dickinson asked.

"They have not responded to my hails," the station manager said. "They're just sitting out there in a direct line with our jump point. They came in at a different point."

"Beyond the last planet's orbit?" I asked.

"Yes," the station manager said, surprised.

"That is the one I use," i said. I find the Terry jump point problematic."

"There is more than one?" Detective Roni Camberwell asked.

"If you know where it is and howopen it," I said. "I can accelerate at a higher G-force to it and open it without slowing down. It means I am traveling faster when I exit hyperspace. The regular jump point requires waiting in line and letting the jump gate open and shut."

"But the Pantherans," the station manager said. "They're blocking entry and exit. The jump gate is locked down."

But as we weatched, two more ships came through the jump gate. One was a bronze saucer, the other a  ."
bronze torch ship with two trof the body of the ship, its long fins stnsparent domes, one at either end o 

 It's gorgeous," Detective Roni Camberwell breathed. "It's the little one, right?"

What are they waiting for?" the Czarina asked.

"Probably for Major Whicher to contact them," Emily Dickinson said.

"Richie?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.

"He's dead," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "He tried to kidnap Star. Emily Dickinson shot him."

"Oh, my God," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Why?"

"He was a Pantheran informer," Emily Dickinson told her, "class two. We found the micro card."

"Well, that might explain a few things," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo."

"Indeed," Emily Dickinson said.

"But the warships," the station manager
whined.

"Open a channel," I sid.

"I've tried--" the station manager said.

"Just give Captain Star Runner a communication link," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Star, ask them what they want."

"Channel ready," the staiton manager said.

I spoke in my own language, using military protocol. Who are you? What do you want? The message was simple. 

The view on the station manager's display screen shifted to the bridge of one of the warships. A gendered Pantheran looked directly at us.

"Fuschia-colored Pantheran," he said. "We want the following Terran individuals." He gave me four names.

"I will relay your request," I replied and signaled the station manager to mute my microphone.

The detail commanderasks for the three Board of Directors of Hypatia, Inc.," I said, "Simon Pickford, Mustafa Aziz and Mikhail Stanneslovsky and Major Richard Whicher."

"That catterwalling said that?" asked Emily Dickinson.

I ignored him. The intonations of my own language cannot be described thusly though Terries insist on calling it yowling. There were many syllables. I heard more growls, hisses and a fair amount of spitting. These individuals were clearly not friends. 

"I believe they consider these individuals undesirable," I said.

"We agree on that score," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "Is Major Richard Whicher among the undesireables, Star?"

"Yes," I said. 

"Good," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "They won't care if he is dead."

"The other three?" I asked.

"Are aboard the space yachet in line for the jump point," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"Shall I relay this information?"

"Please do," Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo. said.

I did.

"So the double dealing Major Rihard Whicher is dead by a Terry weapon," the commander of the Pantheran military detail spat.

"Yes," I said.

"Good ridance. I do not like traitors to one's own species."

I said nothing.

"We will emove the three remaining scumbags from the yachet and be gone."

"May I inquire," I said.

"You may not, fuschia-colored androgen. It is no business of yours."

The transmission ended.

I reported my findings. We watched as a warship detached itself from the other two and made its way toward the space yacht. It turned to flee, but there was no place for it to run. The other two warships boxed it in. One docked with the yacht, then withdrew. There was no shooting. The space yacht captain protected his or her own ship. A smart move.

Well," I said, "that takes care of three of the miscreants. What about the others."

"We have asked the captain of the passengerliner to return to port," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. "It has been holding position with the arrival of the warships. As for Deadley Dudley and thunder Bone Bobby, we have not located them. Gail Jeffreys, Stephen Silk and Zora O'Neill Eisenhower (Zoe) are on the passengerliner."

They were still on station a few hours ago," Emily Dickinson said. "They're probably still here. I think, from what we have gathered, their usefulness came to an end with the other three."

"We'll interrogate Silk, Jeffreys and O'Neill when they are returned," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "We may sort out this affair yet."

"And Dudley and Bobby?" the Czarina asked.

"We'll pick them up, too, for questioning," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "Station security is watching for them. They can't get off the station without our knowing it. Don't worry, Czarina. I suspect they will have lots to tell us to save their own skin. The department has a very dim view of them roughing up one of its officers."

Over the station manager's communications line the fluting tones of the Plumie language sounded. I can understand Plumie though I cannot speak it.

"They are asking permission to dock the torch ship," I said.

"What about the other ship?" the station manager asked.

"It will stay at the periffery," I said. "It is difficult to dock the saucer shape at Terry installations. I know. My last ship was like that and this one is much bigger. Give them room to throw a line to the torch ship. Its pilot will come across."

"Done," the station manager said, giving the orders.

We watched. The torch ship docked at the end of a peer and a space-suited figure emerged and made its way to the saucer-shaped ship. The Plumies reversed course and headed to the jump point, their work done.

"Incoming message from the torch ship," the station manager said.

We all heard CChristabel's clear voice.

"Captain Star Runner's new ship has been delivered," she said. "Initiating protocols to make the ship Pantheran habitable. Commencing now. Estimate for Pantheran occupation is twenty-two hours, standard Terran time."

"Acknowledged," I said. "Welcome aboard."

And that was that.

Shortly, all the individuls were in custody. As Detective Roni Camberwell had thought, Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bobby cooperated to the fullest extent possible. Their sentence, to be banished from the Pharaoh Star System for a year and a day. 
 What," the Czarina asked as we all sat on the terrace at Shepheard's Hotel, "was the overall plan?"
"one evening several days later."It's like this, we think," Detective Roni Camberwell explained to the Czarina, Captain Gyllian Romeres 
Lujo, Emily Dickinson and me

"You know about the nuclear waste site at the Landscape of Thorns?"

We all affirmed that we did.

"The three directors, Mustafa Aziz, Mikhail Stanneslovsky, and Simon Pickford hired Deadly Dudley and Thunder Bone Bbby to waylay ships coming through the Eastern Gate and remove the surplus androgens. Neither Deadly Dudley noThunder Bone Bobby know what the androgens were told. Their orders were simply to remove them and transport them to the Landscape of Thorns, to make it look like robbery on the high seas."

I always thought this term was humorous. To equate the vastness of space to planetary oceans seemed ludacrous to me, but then my species did not have a history of piracy on the oceans or anywhere else. The thought of setting out in a tiny vessel onto an ocean struck me as far-fetched and entirely disagreeable. Terries, however, found it enjoyable and did it often for the sheer fun of it. I suppose they are entitled to teir odd ideas.

"Of course," Detective Roni Camberwell continued, "the two made a point of other forms of robbery with each ship they encountered so they made out pretty well."

"Then, somehow, they found out about Stephen Silk and the others. This part is rather vague. They said something about a bar. I suspect one of the directors was a bit loose-lipped. Anyway, they heard about Stephen Silk, Gail Jeffreys and Zoe Eisenhower. It turns out, by the way, Zoe Eisenhower and Zora O'Neill are the same person. So she really had heard about Captain Star Runner from its friend, Tamara.

"Gail Jeffreys is the fanatic in the group. She wanted to use the androgens and the radioactive waste at the Landscape Thorns to create living bombs. She thought she could reintroduce the androgens into Pantheran society and poison the other Pantherans and thus destroy the Pantheran grip on Coalition space from the inside out."

"That would be impossible," I said. "Surplus androgens are not part of Pantheran society."

"Gail Jeffreys apparently did not understand that," Detective Roni Camberwell said.

"And Stephen Silk?" Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"He is an idealist," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "He was both inphatuated with Gail Jeffreys--he found her very romantic and exciting because of her take-on-the-universe stance and he was duped by her into thinking her hairbrain scheme would free the androgens from he opression of Pantheran overlords. He does not understand Pantheran society either. Captain Star Runner has helped us get a picture from the inside."

"An androgen point of view," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"Yes, of course," Detective Roni Camberwell said, a bit uncomfortably.

I looked from one woman to the other.

"The Alliance has longrealized," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo explained to us all, "that Star was taught a particular view of Pantheran society which benefitted the gendered Pantherans. The Fungusians, who are not particularly forthcoming, have explained things are not quite as orderly as Star was taught. Nevertheless, Star's information is not incorrect. It is just," she searched for a word, "the best view of i. Apparently, there are wide swaths of Pantheran society which chaif under the rigidity of the system."

"I never heard this," I said.

"You wouldn't," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. "It is not in anyone's interest for androgens to get more than one outlook. It's really not important to you anymore as you live out here."

"I suppose so," I said out loud, but I was uneasy with this new information. Although Ihad not fared well in Pantheran society, they were my species and it was my homeland.I wondered what the Mother of Us All would say about this.

"Gail Jeffreys," Detective Roni Camberwell continued, "got Zoe Eisenhower to go along with her. I think they may have been lovers at one point and at another point Gail Jeffreys got her out of prison or some scrape in the Southern Frontier. We have inquiries out, just to get a better picture and to possibly send her there for incarceration."

"And the package?" I asked.

"The package was legitimate," Detective Roni Camberwell said. "Stephen Silk really did want to set up a library here to catalog human experience. Packages Promptly simply lost track of it temporarily. Your trace, Star, prompted them to discover their error and to find the package. It arrived yesterday. It was just a package of data chrystals."

"And the rumors?" I asked.

"Just something Gail Jeffreys put out there to distract him," Detective Roni Camberwell said.


"well," Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said, "Emily Dickinson and I are off to the Landscap of Thorns to see what's what there. Now that the Panherans know about it, we want to be certain they have no ongoing interest there outside the Eastern Gate."

"And you, Captain Star Runner?" the Czarina asked.

"Detective Roni Camberwell and I are taking my new shipout for a shakedown cruise."

"How charming," the Czarina said knowingly. "I guess that leaves me here at Shepheard's."

"With your tab paid," I said.

"Ah," the Czarina said, reaching for the menu pad, "not for long."

Detective Roni Camberwell and I made out way out of Shepheard's Hotel, her large hand resting on my shoulder. Our cruise would tell me about our relationship as well as my new ship. The League of Hypatian Pirates had even offered me full status as a Hypatian pirate. My life was about to go in a new direction.

The End
