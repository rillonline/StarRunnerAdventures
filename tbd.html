   Tara Lee O’Rourke and I sat opposite each other in the far back corner of the Elwood Street Diner. We were eating an early breakfast. Tara Lee would be leaving soon to go to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport to return to the Alexandria Space Station and her position as Security Chief there. Tara Lee and I had been dating for nearly a year. She was definitely the most beautiful woman I had ever been with. Where I am large and awkward, Tara Lee is small and graceful. I always feel like an ox next to her while Tara Lee is more like a colorfully plumed bird with a lovely song and an effortless flight high in the sky. At least, that is how I imagine birds are. We do not have songbirds in Ptolemy City.

   At first, being with Tara Lee was a breathtaking experience. Outside of work, she dressed in exquisite clothes, suggested we go to the hot spots in the city and eat at the popular restaurants. We shopped at all the high-end stores for suitable attire for me. I even bought a couple of dresses to wear and the latest footwear with innumerable straps and glitter. It was exciting. I’ve always been a wall flower, having quiet relationships, going out some and spending long hours in quiet company. Now I was, as Tara Lee said, I was tripping the lights fantastic. And if you are wondering, the sex was very good, too.

   I know Tara Lee looked at the Elwood Diner askance. I almost wondered if she would refuse to eat the food but she ordered a hearty breakfast of eggs, fruit and oatmeal. I, on the other hand, was being less successful putting away my cinnamon French toast stuffed with strawberries. A tension had been building between us for the duration of the visit and I did not know what to do to lessen it.

   over a year ago. I doubted Star still called the ride that. Star was the pussy cat which made me the owl though it was the humor of the poem which had caught Star’s attention. Star and Gyllian had a very complicated relationship and, although neither had ever said, I suspected they had been lovers. That, I thought morosely, could be said of most every human Star knew except Tamara, Star’s former ward. Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, working for the Alliance of Planets on the Northern Frontier, wanted to hire me for a job on Hypatia. All she would tell me about it was that I would be working with Tamara.

   Despite the constant buzz of conversation in the room and waiting for Josh to discuss a job possibility, my thoughts went back to Tara Lee. The Village Green was not the sort of place Tara Lee would enjoy. It was a neighborhood place, Muscoda (pronounced Muscadday) by locals. Everyone knows you here and everyone expects you to know them. It was bigger, noisier and more affluent than the Elwood Diner, but both places had this sense of community. You belonged here. Tara Lee enjoyed the fashionable places, where it is important to be seen and where you measure yourself against everyone else in the room. I was always uncomfortable in those places, yet I found Tara Lee so exciting to be with. Not just sexually, but her energy carries me along and it is just fun to be alive in her presence. I could not imagine our relationship being over. She wanted to marry me, to make this relationship permanent and she thought it was my fault that it was not moving forward. “Are you over Star Runner yet?” she had said. Wasn’t I? Star was gone, off to another arm of the galaxy. I did not enjoy space travel and Star was a creature of space. Designed for space travel Star would say and Star would be right about that characterization. Besides, Captain Star Runner is an ungendered Pantheran, an alien, not a human being male or female. We were not compatible. But I could not forget Star or not respond to the people, human beings, I met while in Star’s company.

   hat night I activated my link every twenty minutes or so to call or text Tara Lee, to see how she was doing, to apologize, for what I did not know, to tell her I was lonely, to tell her I missed her, to tell her I did not like the feeling hat things were not good between us. Each time I opened my link, I hesitated. I felt so incredibly stupid. I wondered if anything I said or wrote would be the truth. Her words about Star stung. It was over between Star and me, but I still had a great deal of respect for Captain Star Runner. How could I put that part of my life out of mind. Star could, of course. A memory reorganization would put memories of me and our time together far away from Star’s consciousness. Star could look them up, could go into the archives and retrieve everything, but it was not the same as I experienced memory. How could associating myself with the people I met when Star and I were together be such a bad thing. Was Tara Lee so threatened by these people and by Star also? That seemed crazy to me. Tara Lee was at the top of her game, pretty, smart. She had it altogether. Then why,I wondered, did she want anything to do with me? And finally, despite what she had said just before leaving the Elwood Street Diner, why was she not calling me? Did her heart ache for me? Was she reaching for her link just as I was reaching for mine? Or was she going about her business on the Alexandria Space Station as if nothing was amiss. That is how I imagined her, totally compartmentalized, going to meetings, seeing people in her office, solving problems, walking through the station with her confident stride, respected by everyone she met.

   Th next morning I decided to walk to Shepheard’s Hotel. Maybe exercise and walking alongside Lake Memphis would clear my mind and make up for the lack of restful sleep. I could not face my exercise routine right now. That was a bad sign, but a private investigator has to do what a private investigator has to do.

   I have a favorite part of the Loop Road which goes around Lake Memphis in the center of Ptolemy City. Much of the lake front is taken up with businesses and the waterfront for boats and swimmers. But here and there the designers of this part of the city created parkland with trees and paths for walkers, runners and cyclists. I walked by the lake’s edge, hearing the gentle slap of the water and smelling the vegetation. My link played soft sounds reminiscent of an earth like forest—or at least that is what the app description said. My link had selected this particular sound track as a soothing accompaniment to my walk. Along with tracking my steps, calories burned and respiration and heartbeat, the link assessed other biological indicators and proposed this sound scape. It reminded me of what Christabel, Star Runner’s artificial intelligence, might do for Star, though Christabel would also be adjusting Star’s body chemistry. Today Cristabel would choose a lot of mood altering chemicals and vitamins along with an energy booster. Star was never alone. Christabel was always in Star’s mind and they kept up a constant chatter between them, sometimes in direct conversation and sometimes more subtly on a thought basis. I was uncomfortable with this at first. It was as if there was a third person always observing us, recording us, making suggestions to Star. After a while though I began to understand how integral a part to Star’s existence Star’s AI is and that sense of a third person faded. It was only when I realized how integrated into the spaceship Star was that I felt alienated and distanced from Star. That was when the bad times happened.

   I did not walk through the great expanse of the Shepheard’s Hotel lobby. Standing in its cavernous space always reminded me of the first time I saw Captain Star Runner, prancing, a long, delicate scarf trailing out behind Star. I remember catching my breath at Star’s magnificence and grace, tail held high and those long legs and shiny fuchsia-colored fur. You could sum it up as animal magnetism but it was the first time I understood the power and sensibility of Pantherans. They walk as if they own the galaxy and as far as the western spiral arm goes, they probably do. Some call it arrogance but when it comes packaged with such an awesome physical presence, it is hard not to be impressed.

   I could reach the Terrace Cafe by going along a path lined with luxuriant foliage along one side of the hotel. I stepped onto the terrace which occupies a space between the hotel and the wall of the dome. The dome is transparent. The landscape of Hypatia spreads out before those on the terrace in all its unearthly splendor. Toxic air currents swirl red and yellow patterns against the rock face a quarter mile away. In the distance, volcanoes continually erupt, spewing magma and mist in great plumes into the sky. I paused to watch the show for a few minutes. I was born in Ptolemy City. The view is the only landscape I had ever seen before my one space trip. I can now say I have walked on grass and breathed a planet’s atmosphere. It was a strange and frightening feeling. Standing within the confines of the dome, I felt reassured by its nearness and fascinated yet again by the ever-changing kaleidescope of color before me.

   After Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, Captain Star Runner, Tamara and I learned what the Landscape of Thorns was all about, Star brought Tamara and me back to the Pharaoh Star System. Star and I had agreed to break up our relationship. I went back to our villa to get my things and get back on my feet. Star and Gyllian went on to the Northern Frontier. Tamara went with me to the villa and then we went our own ways. I thought Tamara was doing some sightseeing or rest and relaxation here. She had said something about finding the Hypatian landscape breathtaking. I did not think much about her remarks. I was consumed by my own difficult situation and was glad my responsibilities as her host were at an end. I preferred being bad company to myself than trying to be pleasant to Star’s oldest friend. Don’t get me wrong. Tamara is a nice person. It’s just, well, she thinks the galaxy of Star and right then, I was not so inclined to be one of Star’s biggest fans.

   The contract was fine according to my legal review service. I electronically signed it and returned it to Gyllian. I also had the legal service draw up contracts for Josh, The Czarina and Captain Kidd. They all signed them. On Hypatia, the contract rules. I had their silence and their cooperation. They had their pay and a general outline of their responsibilities. I expected The Czarina and Captain Kidd to continue to be located in Ptolemy City. For the present, they did not have the complete picture as I knew it. They were instructed to listen for any talk about the southern continent, the Alliance of Planets, the Pantherans and Tamara’s name. As general as these parameters were, Josh and I thought this would be sufficient for now until we had a better grasp of the situation on the southern continent.

   Many questions remain about the whole investigation. We might never be told what the outcome of Tamara’s investigation was. That was not part of the contract. Nor was I likely to learn what information had been discovered to prompt this investigation. Gyllian’s explanation sounds very weak to me. Her fear of Pantheran reprisal sounds quite plausible to me. More and more I am seeing how manipulative and self-interested the Pantherans are. They are certainly not a benevolent force in the Coalition. I remember the first time I heard Star refer to the Pantheran dominance in the Coalition as the Pantheran Empire. Despite Star’s lack of standing in the Pantheran sphere of influence and their antipathy toward Star, Star seemed quite proud of The Race and their superior position in the western spiral arm. I needed to keep that Pantheran arrogance in mind. I had seen at the Landscape of Thorns their willingness to sweep in with warships.

   It is not required for anyone to file a flight plan when leaving the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. Of course you can file one if you want to. This does make it possible for you to be traced if something goes wrong, but with a poisonous atmosphere and very hot or very cold temperatures the likelihood of your surviving a crash or other technical malfunction is very low. It is more likely that you do not want your travel to be traced. As this was the character of our travel, we simply let the modified star runner trainee flier takeoff and after a time, when we were far beyond the city, plot its flight path to the southern continent.

   I had been to the southern continent before. Our villa was located near the southern pole. I knew Star sold the villa but I did not know to whom. As I reviewed our flight plan on the display in front of me, I saw we were going to be setting down within a few hundred miles of the villa. The good news was that we were relatively far away from the ring of volcanoes which circled Hypatia along the fortieth parallel south. The bad news was that Hypatia was extremely cold at this latitude indicated for the dig. That meant we could not sped any time outdoors even in our environmental suits. They were rated for the Hypatian cold, but only that around Ptolemy City which was in a very temperate zone–temperate as far as Hypatia was concerned. Hypatia was at the extreme distant from Pharaoh for human existence.

   I wasn’t sure of the adjective “perfectly”, but I accepted the flier’s assurance. Star would not have flown a vehicle that was not performing up to its specifications.

There may be a lot of corruption on Hypatia, but everyone took reliable fliers and spacecraft to be sacrosanct.

   “Neither are we,” Tamara said. “Tech;Technically, according to Gyllie, the Pharaoh Star System is open to all–humans, Featherote Charm, the Fungusian Network and the Pantherans to name the major races. Given that it is occupied by humans, it may not be as open as all that. As we are a human facility managed by both a university and a governmental agency, we’re hoping that is enough not to cause a fracas.”

   I wondered uneasily if we would return to the subject. The thought of Pantheran warships firing on Hypatia made me very queasy indeed. I did not think the Rich and Famous and the League of Hypatian Pirates would take well to eventuality. I wondered if they would have a response. It certainly might dissuade the tourist trade from being so brisk. People might find other places to conduct business and Ptolemy City would fall on hard times. If it was no longer profitable, the whole city and the Alexandria Space Station could fold. Thinking of the space station prompted me to think of Tara Lee. What would she say about this? How much had she guessed. Was her outburst more driven by fear than personal promise with me? To be continued, I thought, as we passed through the airlock into the dig.

   “Artifacts,” Josh chimed in, “human history, dig, big dig, names of everyone on site, University of the Gifted Mind, archeology, Alliance of Planets even the South Pole.

   The first expansion into space was hampered by time and distance. Spaceships could only travel at sub light speeds. This meant that humanity could only hope to colonize other planets and asteroids in the home system. Although science fiction had always proposed colonists would be in cryogenic sleep, the medical and scientific communities never developed this technology. Alternatively, writers had imagined generational ships. These, by design, would have to be all things to all people. That design never got off the ground literally or figuratively. The flights had to be short enough that extensive governmental systems were unnecessary. Although hes were necessary when the people reached their new home, they still were in close enough radio contact that they could consult with colleagues back on Earth to resolve any major issues. These colonies grew but the available technology was just not available. Sustaining colonies on the Moon, Mars, and moons of some of the outer planets and a few asteroids proved possible but not necessarily attractive. Mostly they were mining operations with the workers and their families rotating in and out. This was costly but the results of their mining efforts were worth it.

   The material I read focused on Pantheran motivations. The Pantherans appeared at first to be benevolent purveyors of technology. They gave the specifications for jump gates and told human beings where to put them. They helped build the guidance systems which allowed humanity to traverse hyperspace safely. Back on earth, engineers were able to reverse engineer both the gates and the guidance systems to outfit many ships. What the engineers and other researchers could not figure out was where to put them. In fact, this is still a mystery. All jump gates known to humanity have been positioned by Pantherans.

   I know from personal experience that star runners can sense where insertion and extraction points are. Star can open long disused gates or gates that are in poor repair. Star runners don’t need gates at all. Star can often choose insertion and extraction points which will allow Star to get from here to there more quickly than human captains can because they have to use established jump gates. It is not clear to humans whether this is a gift that only certain Pantherans have randomly or whether there are specific genetic markers which indicate the Pantheran will be able to make these determinations. Further, it is not understood exactly how a Pantheran senses insertion and extraction points.

By their isolation, villas often have great amounts of food stored in them so it would be a long time before anyone questioned it. The chatter The Czarina was liable to hear was that I was opening the villa back up again. There might be speculation about Star’s return or our getting back together again. I wondered if Tara Lee would hear this and how it would affect her silence. I kept checking for messages but none came. I felt awful about this but I could not yet imagine what I could say or do to repair the breech. I was not ready to commit myself to Tara Lee to the exclusion of others forever and ever. I wondered if finding another girl friend would let me know if I was serious about Tara Lee. That sounded would very unfair to the other woman so I dismissed it from my mind.

I jostled the flier quite a bit. I could feel the flier resetting itself into proper trim and then handing the controls back to me.

   Even if Star returned to the Pharaoh Star System, I imagined Star and I could share this villa and not both be here at the same time. That gave me an opportunity to picture Tara Lee and myself here. Would she like it? Could I imagine the two of us curled up on the floor before this fire, the many brightly colored cushions piled up against our backs or strewn across the floor as an elaborate mattress? I remembered the wild ride in the flier here. I remembered many days spent with Star–the beauty of the wild landscape outside and the exotic lovemaking inside. Star was full of surprises. That day I particularly remembered the softness of Star’s fur and the deep rumble of Star’s purr. Going to all of Ptolemy City’s hot spots with Tara Lee was exciting. Coming back to my coop for intense sex was something which could get my heart beating and my body pulsing. But a snowy afternoon with Star before this fire was a very special memory. Could Tara Lee leave the pulsing music and elegant restaurants of Ptolemy City behind for a retreat to this villa? I did not know. We never tried it. Just picturing her in her Lacey lingerie lounging on these pillows caused me to become aroused. I missed her. I missed her laughter. I missed watching her do her nails. I missed watching her exercise, her muscles tensing and relaxing. I missed admiring her flexibility and strength. She was indeed beautiful–fully clothed and completely naked. I wanted to run my hands all over her body. How could I have let her walk out of the Elwood Street Diner alone? What made me think taking her there would bring us closer together? Tara Lee was a pearl of great price and I had not given it the suitable surroundings it deserved.

   I find my notes for this period are quite repetitive. I kept bringing supplies to Tamara and her exploration of the tunnels. I kept dropping by the villa. There were no repeats of the base’s flier, or any flier for that matter,visiting the villa. Every time I saw Tamara, she appeared more worried and less communicative. No other significant finds occurred. The team cleared more and more tunnels. They seemed to go on for ever and ever. Scans of the area were inconclusive. The area appeared to be shielded but no definite information could be found. Tunnels would stop abruptly or ramp down to tunnels underneath the already explored level. Nothing was found.Except for the murals, the tunnels appeared to be empty of any clues.

   I was home. I was caught up on all my work. I was at home with nothing to do, no where to go and no one to do nothing with. Tara Lee had not contacted me. I had not contacted her. I did not know what to message, what to say, what to do except to say that I missed her and thought about her all the time. Since her ultimatum at the Elwood Street Diner, I had not returned there. I hid in my coop and felt sorry for myself. I had no answers to Tara Lee. I felt completely stuck. I could not go forward with my relationship with Tara Lee and I could not resume my relationship with Captain Star Runner. Both of them were out of reach. I did not think I could even consider going out with someone else.

   “And what is our role?” I asked. Truth to tell, I had no investment in the Consortium of Planets or the Solar League. If either of them went away, things could be tough in the Pharaoh Star System, but we would still have the League of Hypatian Pirates, the free port of Three Ravens on the Southern Frontier and a lot of folks who would want to go to the Aesculapius Medical Facility. They were entrenched on Cleopatra, depending primarily on the League of Hypatian Pirates for their supplies. And the Coalition needed the antonium from the mines on Mark Antony.In my humble opinion, and not being up-to-speed on all the political and financial ramifications, I figured this kept us pretty safe from Coalition, meaning Pantheran, interference. That the Consortium of Planets had sent one of its agents to interrogate and then assassinate two people on Hypatia was troubling but then Hypatia preferred to be a lawless place where such things could happen.

   “Things inside the Coalition are quite tense,” Emily Dickinson said. “The Pantherans keep having reasons to have a greater military presence and less autonomy by the races inside the Coalition. Their spy networks are so good it is difficult for any organized resistance to their activity to be effective. The Solar League has appealed to the Consortium for help. The planets on the Southern Frontier are not organized so they cannot be of much held. Mostly those planets are either agricultural or held by families like on Fair Haven. The Consortium can do a few things–I’m not at liberty to say anything about what they are doing and I don’t know a lot anyway–but this operation on Hypatia seemed worth pursuing. It might just give us a way to work around the Pantherans.”

   It took us some time to walk there. The villa looked small on the outside but it was extremely extensive on the inside. The room we had first entered was a reception area. It could serve as a convenient living area. A kitchen was nearby. But when we went farther, we discovered this area was just to let people think it was a small villa. There were much more lavish areas underground–rooms and rooms. I had been to Adam Worth’s official residence. It was large, gaudy and filled with expensive furnishings and artwork. This villa seemed to be furnished with equally expensive items and a larger collection of artwork. I wondered if anyone else knew of it. It could fund Tamara’s operation all by itself and it was here for the taking. There was no claim on this villa. I checked while I walked. There would be no harm in putting a claim in, I thought, so I did. I had the financial resources to even put a claim of formal ownership. As I reached the cavern where a number of fliers were parked, the registration office back in Ptolemy City accepted my claim and deducted the funds from my account.

   There were several fliers of different design that I thought could safely be classified as belonging to the villa. After these, there were three more. One was clearly marked as a rental. I went through it, found pieces of luggage that were definitely belonging to Denise Kahlil and removed them. I would check them out later. After checking the cargo hold, I instructed the flier’s simple AI to fly back to its rental slot at the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. The rental agency would be glad to have it back.

   There was clothing and other personal items. I set them aside. There was her cred-pack. I put those in my bag. Among her identification information were tickets for a shuttle and passage back to the Solar League via Three Ravens. I could cash them in on Alexandria Space Station. They were not part of her personal profile but were stand-alone items which could not be traced to her. Perhaps the Solar League Examiner had paid for them. Perhaps the Pantherans had paid for them. In either case, they did not want any record of the transaction on file. As a result, I could cash them in and would. This job was turning out to be very different from what Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo had represented it to be. I would need to pay my people regardless of how things ended between Gyllian and me. These tickets would do just that.

   The flight through the ring of volcanoes was tense. The base flier strained to get through the pass. Thankfully, it had enough power to make it to the base. If it had not enough power, Josh and I would have been stranded and would have died. Neither of us had considered the possibilities. We needed to check on power and radio contact abilities. We were learning the hard way how to survive on this hostile planet of ours. We were creatures of the dome around Ptolemy City. Although I had been in space for a much longer time than Josh had, I had been in the care of an experienced star runner. I found spaceships confining and space travel filled with unrelenting boredom, but I did not experience the fear of not getting to our destination. Star’s confidence and competence permeated Star’s ship and I never doubted Star’s ability to get us to where we were going safely. I now had an inkling of what that took and Star made it look easy.

It’s a long way out from the core planets of the Consortium. My parents died there. I became a ward of the space station manager, a woman by the name of Prudence Wu. One day a star runner docked at our station and ate at the diner where I worked. We talked. Star was so naive about everything human. It was like educating a little kid but Star was all grown up. I found I could pour out my troubles to Star and Star would listen. Star never forgot, never did not listen. My dream was to go to University. There was money to send me but no way to get me there. Star took me. Prudence Wu made Star my legal guardian which was weird, but Star made all the necessary arrangements for me to enroll at the University of the Gifted Mind and stay there. I don’t know how much Star paid the University. My financial aid was never enough.”

I know the Intelligence Branch of the Pantherans went after you on the Featherote planet and kicked us out of the Prince Hat System. But I just can’t imagine the Pantherans are out to annihilate us. It seems to me they might want to re-establish their empire, but they need people like us to lord it over. I like living on the Northern Frontier and I like being free of all their restrictions. But what I learn from archeology is that there are always forces stronger than you out there in the universe, in the western spiral arm if you want to make it specific to our situation. That makes me think we may need the Pantherans to defend us. They have been the ones with military capabilities in this part of the galaxy for thousands of years. That could prove to be important.”

   “What happened to Emily Dickinson,” I asked when we were gathered in the spacious room overlooking the lake. Today several powered sailboats were traveling up and down the narrow lake. The sails were for show. Although air circulates throughout Ptolemy City, there is no wind to speak of. The sails are braced so that they appear to be full and functional. One of the house bots served drinks and there were what Mrs. Parge calls nibbles set out on a low table.

Pirates have treasure and they do pray on the weak and the defenseless. But pirates are more than common criminals–at least some of us are. There are thugs, of course.” Captain Kidd glanced in The Czarina’s direction. Her former husband, Deadly Dudley, was one of those thugs. “Posthumous Patty Parine and Dagger Dan Duncan illustrate the worst of the pirate fraternity. Pirates–the real pirates–are folks who like their freedom and like operating with few restrictions. Your Captain Star Runner is a natural pirate, Ronnie. I always supported that cat’s inclusion in the League.”

   I started to worry big time then. If Captain Kidd thought we needed an exit strategy hat included Over the Moon, I wondered what I had gotten us into. I never thought of Gyllian as devious. I knew she had manipulated Star in the past for her own ends, but Star had not understood human ways of doing things at the time. Star did not hold a grudge about it. I wondered if that was a stance I should adopt or if I should demand explanations. I did not think Gyllian could manipulate Captain Kidd. I hated to admit it. I think of myself as having a lot of street smarts, but clearly I was not handling this situation well.

   “We don’t know that,” Gyllian said. “They left the tunnels and covered up any word about themselves. Where did they go? Who did they become? I think they found a way to fight the Pantherans or at least escape from them. I want to know more about that. The Second Space Expansion was a bloody time. How did they get out here and how did they survive? If we could know that, there may be a way to resist the Pantherans when they come for us.”

   It looks like I have some time line issues. In #Sanctuary*, my 2010 Nanowrimo novel for Captain Star Runner, Star returns to the western spiral arm four years after breaking up with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Star finds Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo involved with Lester, a Professor at the University of the Gifted Mind. Emily Dickinson has gone to the Southern Frontier and has not been heard of since. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo encourages Star to contact Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Star does. Ronnie invites Star to come to the Pharaoh Star System. Star reunites with Ronnie at the Intergalactic Diner. Meanwhile, there are ongoing insurrections within the Coalition and Star does not think the Pantherans will use excessive force because they do not want to show their hand and their much superior military force.

   This is a different time line than I am working on here. Only a year and some months have passed. The Pantherans seem to be ready to show excessive force, their shock and awe campaign. Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo is concerned that any revolutionary or terrorist act will bring the Pantherans down on the other races. For the arc I have in mind, Star needs to come back sooner and to Ronnie in a different state.

   Some of this can be corrected by just moving this episode forward in time for Ronnie and the others. Additional Ronnie episodes could be written for the interim. All very confusing. However, these novellas are not set in stone and the inconsistencies can be left alone for now. It looks like I really have to start putting these stories in order and filling in the missing pieces.

Four years ago (A time line correction placed here.) I had spent some time with her on one of Captain Star Runner’s adventures, but that was all. I knew her. That was all.

   Captain Kidd shrugged. “Everyone would be upset. They’d want to go after them, of course, insist on our independence, etc., but nothing would happen. There is no ship in the League of Hypatian Pirates that could go up against one of their military vessels. We’d be out gunned and outmaneuvered. I’ve never sailed with Captain Star Runner, but I’ve watched him run his ship from afar. He can run faster and slide in and out of the Silence more smoothly than any captain I’ve ever met. And that’s in a courier ship with little cargo space. The military vessels are so much bigger.”

   Tara Lee was walking casually dressed in her security chief uniform. She was looking around. She called it managing by walking around. She got a feel for the station, what was going on, and what her people were up to. She could sit at her desk and review all the monitors. She often did. But Tara Lee also got out and made herself known. Her people never knew when they would find her looking over their shoulders. If they were doing their jobs, all well and good. But if they were not, there would be trouble. Tara Lee was very unforgiving on the job. I wondered how unforgiving she was in her personal life.

   My flying lessons from the training flier continued. On the one hand, the flier was able to give me both verbal instructions and display helpful diagrams on the screen in front of my seat. On the other hand, it was curt in its corrections of my errors and slowness to respond. I gathered coddling its trainees, encouragement and a sense of humor were totally absent when training potential star runners. The lack of any personal connection unnerved me. All the AIs I had ever interacted with except perhaps very basic ones in a caravan had some humor and warmth programmed in. They could repeat the same instruction over and over again without sounding irritated or condescending. This was not true of the flier’s AI. I was definitely at the bottom of my class and probably the slowest and the stupidest trainee it had ever had. But then again, I was not genetically designed and engineered to fly a craft. Nevertheless, I persisted. That wild ride with Star piloting back in the day has always stuck with me. We survived not because the AI knew what to do but because Star knew how to get as much as possible out of the flier. Star used the AI but also brought Star’s own experience and skill to bear. I did not know if I would ever need that kind of flying in my job, but you never know.

   Captain Kidd and I returned to Ptolemy City via the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. We each went our separate ways. I stayed at the spaceport until readying two fliers. I instructed Star’s raining flier to at the Alexandria Space Station to pick up Tara Lee at the appropriate time. I knew Tara Lee would not like this reminder of Captain Star Runner, but the training flier was space worthy and reliable. It would arrive in a timely fashion, negotiate docking, wait for Tara Lee and bring her safely to the villa. I recorded a message to this affect, leaving out the part about Captain Star Runner, of course. If the flier volunteered this information, so be it. If Tara Lee guessed, so be it. I did not want to be deceitful or devious.

   The personal flier that Josh and I brought from the villa–it definitely needed a name–received the supplies I ordered as soon as I climbed aboard the shuttle craft. Josh confirmed the house AI reported an ample stock of food stuffs and other household items. I had perishable goods brought in. The hydroponic tanks were empty. I would have to work out how to revitalize them. In the meantime, we could run over to Star’s villa. Those tanks were now operational. I made sure items Tara Lee liked were available and laid in some special items for our enjoyment. Finally, I launched several coded searches on the political situation inside and outside the Coalition. I also did a deep background check on Gyllian. It felt invasive but I needed to know. Finally, after consulting with the team via chat, I sent a query to the Fungusian Network on the same two subjects. They might or might not respond. In the years I have been dealing with them, their helpfulness varies. They do not always choose to respond with anything I could not find elsewhere.

   As far as we could tell, no word of the Big Dig had slipped out. This did not mean it had not. It only meant we did not know about it. Denise Kahlil’s presence on Hypatia was troubling and her connection to the Pantheran General Secretary’s office (Note to self: flesh this out a bit more. I said she was passing information to the Pantherans but I need to be more specific. The General Secretary is the executive of the Coalition. The General Secretary works with the Assembly of the Races which passes legislation for the General Secretary to put into practice, or not, as the General Secretary see fit. The General Secretary is always an ungendered Pantheran whose appointment is confirmed by the Assembly of the Races. No assembly has ever refused to confirm a Pantheran appointee. In addition, it is important to mention that the Pantherans do not send any representatives to the Assembly of the Races. They are not equal partners. Their role is clearly that of caretaker and benevolent overlord. In practice, the Coalition is more feudal than democratic while pretending to be the latter.)

   And there it was. Either way, we were dependent on Pantheran restraint. The only way we could counter the Pantherans were if we mounted a western spiral arm wide revolt and that was unlikely. And if we did, who would maintain the jump gates? Would we be putting ourselves back to the way it was during the First Space Expansion? Whole planets would starve or go back to a a commercial and industrial system which could no longer depend on space flight and the interchange between planets and races. How long before the neural net failed? Each planet would become its own world with no outside interaction. “The problem with this whole situation is,” I said, “there are no good guys and no bad guys. There is something to be said for each position.”

   Reasonable was not a proper adjective. Over the top might be a better one–deep plush carpets, thick draperies, mirrors, mirrors, mirrors! A bed with more controls than I thought I could ever master. The clothes had been removed and recycled. The closet space was vast. The tub with its sprays and temperature settings would be fun to splash around in. I knew Tara Lee would know just how to make it pleasurable. Her repertoire of lovemaking scenarios seemed endless. I had never made up my mind if this meant she was inventive, well-schooled on videos or well-traveled. I never asked. A smile came to my face looking at the pool of bubbling water. I could get in this pool with Tara Lee and be swept away. We would laugh and kiss and do all sorts of things I asked Jacques not to record unless we specifically asked him to. Star would never even get near anything like this. Star was through and through cat when it came to water.

   For some time, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo has been crusading for the Consortium of Planets, in cooperation with the Solar League, to be skeptical of Coalition claims of neutrality toward the non-Pantheran races. She maintains that the Pantheran agenda is to subjugate the other races and establish its hegemony in the western spiral arm. Her activities, although widely supported by the Consortium of Planets upper echelons privately, is problematic for its public image of wanting to cooperate with the Coalition to reopen borders between the Coalition and the Northern Frontier. More advanced planets are trying to develop a closer relationship with their counterparts in the Solar League and like-minded planets of other races. Her biggest support comes from more frontier planets deeper inside the northern territory. Her dismissal from the Ministry of Defense is seen as a victory for the moderates and a setback to the ore radical elements. Some documents suggest, however, that highly positioned people in the government agree with her and this dismissal is only a public relations move. Colonel Gyllian Romeres may still be employed by the Intelligence Branch and is working undercover in plain sight.

   “Pantheran,” I said, “specifically, star runner Pantheran. That flier was once a star runner training ride. It was re purposed and given to a Pantheran agent known on Hypatia at Richard III, Duke of the Gloucester Road. It was outfitted to be used by a human being–the displays and verbal inputs and outputs. On a very wild run–which I won’t go into–Captain Star Runner discovered it was of Pantheran design and re-established its star runner interface. The two of them discovered the flier had been Star’s trainer. They got on famously. Star claimed the flier and made more human adaptations so I could fly it–I use that word loosely. I still have access to the flier. I keep it because it can fly with the Pharaoh Star System. So, I could use it to fetch you here directly–no going to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport, no renting a flier, no going from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere and halfway around the planet. We’re down under big time here.”

But in that moment of feeling the tip of her finger touch me in that way, I thought of Star’s tongue doing the same thing and how much I wanted her finger to be rough and warm and moist the way Star’s tongue was.

Star said nothing. All communication with the flier was in Star’s head. We saw the results on the display.

   Christabel signed off. My hands fell to my lap. All her memories erased. That meant memories of our time together were erased, too. What we had said to each other, what we had done, her request for my return and my promise to return. I was devastated. I only returned to Gyllian’s presentation slowly. I wanted to be alone, to rage, to cry. It looked like that on this busy ship I would not have the opportunity. I would deal with Gyllian later. Well, probably not. She would site security reasons and personal loss and devastation would not be considered important. And how could I say they were in the face of these large and complicated political and military events. Would Hypatia and the Pharaoh Star System ever be the same after the Pantheran incursion?

You have known a star runner with a very strong personality who can function as an individual most of the time. Our Captain Star Runner is quite unique.

   “No,” Christabel said. “This may sound indelicate, but you do not have Star’s undivided attention. It may seem possible to send a ride on a trajectory through Mother Space and have it get to where it is going. That is what your star ships do because there is a lot of information about their hyperspace travel available. That is not the case here. We are in a slightly different fold of space then we used previously. Star is mapping it and deciding if we are truly on course. It is what a star runner does. Because this territory is new, it requires concentration. Star does not need to give its undivided attention to monitoring. I can do a lot of it myself, but Star does need to sample Mother Space regularly. This means sleep periods need to be shortened and scheduled more frequently.”

After all, Christabel was superimposing a sexual program over my input for the full experience since the ungendered could not fully experience sex on their own.

   We approached the extraction point. We all gathered,, bit by bit, in the Lounge. Large screens were superimposed on the walls. They showed hyperspace, or an impression of hyperspace.

I am not certain a human being can really see hyperspace. I wonder if a star runner can.

   Star, speaking as the captain, explained we were approaching our extraction point. Star would need to approach it slowly and examine it carefully. Star had not done an in depth study of the jump gate on Star’s last visit here. What Star could tell us was that the jump gate was very old and different from any jump gate Star had ever seen or studied. It was even different, though similar to, the jump gate we had used in the Pharaoh Star System. Star assured everyone that would not be trapped in hyperspace. There were nearby extraction points. We did not want to use these because nearby extraction points in hyperspace were not nearby in normal space. Star had also noted many extraction points en route we could use if necessary. Star also reminded us that Star had the most up-to-date star charts available.

   The Confederates as they liked to be called were very suspicious of Captain Star Runner at first. Star provided copies of Star’s adventures, both published and unpublished. This helped. Star made a survey of the star systems of the Confederacy of Planets and located a position for a jump gate. It surprised us all that the Confederates could construct one. Star provided hyperspace navigation as well. Knowing Captain Star Runner, these services were not free, but knowing Gyllian, an arrangement was made. After their initial shock, the archaeological expedition settled in for an in-depth study. The Czarina and Captain Kidd stayed, too. Captain Kidd represented the League of Hypatian Pirates and went into negotiations. The Czarina saw an opportunity to ingratiate herself into many potential sources for information.

   What we learned in the Confederacy would be highly confidential for some time. The implications of putting the Confederacy on the western galactic arm’s map needed to be considered. Gyllian wanted to set up trade talks. It would benefit both the Confederacy and the Northern Frontier to exchange goods, services, ideas and people. Their first task was to study the effect on relations with the Pantherans. I pointed out they needed to get the Fungusian Network into their discussions since as soon as Star’s backups were taken, the Fungusian Network would be aware of the Confederacy. This was done and ways of protecting themselves against unwarranted Pantheran investigation were opened.

   Star found a quick and easy way to travel to the Northern Frontier through Mother Space and we dropped Gyllian off. Then we turned for home. I spent time with Star. We did a lot of talking. Star also spent more time away from the runner’s area, going back to adjust its biological systems and to integrate more closely with ship operations. Being away from the runner’s area meant a more normal – at least for me – interaction. It felt more like being at home.

   One of the Pantheran warships docked at the Alexandria Space Station. They questioned both the woman we met in the coffee shop and Tara Lee, but they could provide no specifics. The Pantheran presence there was disruptive and the Pantherans made no friends while they were in port. They left quite huffily. The League of Hypatian Pirates and many of the Rich and Famous filed a protest through the Solar League to the Assembly of Planets. As yet there had been no response. No one aboard Star’s ship was surprised by this.

<h1>Tara Lee O’Rourke and I sat opposite each other in the far back corner of the Elwood Street Diner. We were eating an early breakfast. Tara Lee would be leaving soon to go to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport to return to the Alexandria Space Station and her position as Security Chief there. Tara Lee and I had been dating for nearly a year. She was definitely the most beautiful woman I had ever been with. Where I am large and awkward, Tara Lee is small and graceful. I always feel like an ox next to her while Tara Lee is more like a colorfully plumed bird with a lovely song and an effortless flight high in the sky. At least, that is how I imagine birds are. We do not have songbirds in Ptolemy City.<a class="headerlink" href="#tara-lee-o-rourke-and-i-sat-opposite-each-other-in-the-far-back-corner-of-the-elwood-street-diner-we-were-eating-an-early-breakfast-tara-lee-would-be-leaving-soon-to-go-to-the-ferris-lighthouse-spaceport-to-return-to-the-alexandria-space-station-and-her-position-as-security-chief-there-tara-lee-and-i-had-been-dating-for-nearly-a-year-she-was-definitely-the-most-beautiful-woman-i-had-ever-been-with-where-i-am-large-and-awkward-tara-lee-is-small-and-graceful-i-always-feel-like-an-ox-next-to-her-while-tara-lee-is-more-like-a-colorfully-plumed-bird-with-a-lovely-song-and-an-effortless-flight-high-in-the-sky-at-least-that-is-how-i-imagine-birds-are-we-do-not-have-songbirds-in-ptolemy-city" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>At first, being with Tara Lee was a breathtaking experience. Outside of work, she dressed in exquisite clothes, suggested we go to the hot spots in the city and eat at the popular restaurants. We shopped at all the high-end stores for suitable attire for me. I even bought a couple of dresses to wear and the latest footwear with innumerable straps and glitter. It was exciting. I’ve always been a wall flower, having quiet relationships, going out some and spending long hours in quiet company. Now I was, as Tara Lee said, I was tripping the lights fantastic. And if you are wondering, the sex was very good, too.<a class="headerlink" href="#at-first-being-with-tara-lee-was-a-breathtaking-experience-outside-of-work-she-dressed-in-exquisite-clothes-suggested-we-go-to-the-hot-spots-in-the-city-and-eat-at-the-popular-restaurants-we-shopped-at-all-the-high-end-stores-for-suitable-attire-for-me-i-even-bought-a-couple-of-dresses-to-wear-and-the-latest-footwear-with-innumerable-straps-and-glitter-it-was-exciting-i-ve-always-been-a-wall-flower-having-quiet-relationships-going-out-some-and-spending-long-hours-in-quiet-company-now-i-was-as-tara-lee-said-i-was-tripping-the-lights-fantastic-and-if-you-are-wondering-the-sex-was-very-good-too" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>I was sitting alone on my balcony at the Womyn’s Cooperative Housing Authority overlooking Lake Memphis when she called. I had not spoken with the colonel since I left Captain Star Runner’s spaceship <em>The Owl and the Pussy Cat</em> over a year ago. I doubted Star still called the ride that. Star was the pussy cat which made me the owl though it was the humor of the poem which had caught Star’s attention. Star and Gyllian had a very complicated relationship and, although neither had ever said, I suspected they had been lovers. That, I thought morosely, could be said of most every human Star knew except Tamara, Star’s former ward. Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, working for the Alliance of Planets on the Northern Frontier, wanted to hire me for a job on Hypatia.

<h1>Despite the constant buzz of conversation in the room and waiting for Josh to discuss a job possibility, my thoughts went back to Tara Lee. The Village Green was not the sort of place Tara Lee would enjoy. It was a neighborhood place, Muscoda (pronounced Muscadday) by locals. Everyone knows you here and everyone expects you to know them. It was bigger, noisier and more affluent than the Elwood Diner, but both places had this sense of community. You belonged here. Tara Lee enjoyed the fashionable places, where it is important to be seen and where you measure yourself against everyone else in the room. I was always uncomfortable in those places, yet I found Tara Lee so exciting to be with. Not just sexually, but her energy carries me along and it is just fun to be alive in her presence. I could not imagine our relationship being over. She wanted to marry me, to make this relationship permanent and she thought it was my fault that it was not moving forward. “Are you over Star Runner yet?” she had said. Wasn’t I? Star was gone, off to another arm of the galaxy. I did not enjoy space travel and Star was a creature of space. Designed for space travel Star would say and Star would be right about that characterization. Besides, Captain Star Runner is an ungendered Pantheran, an alien, not a human being male or female. We were not compatible.

<h1>hat night I activated my link every twenty minutes or so to call or text Tara Lee, to see how she was doing, to apologize, for what I did not know, to tell her I was lonely, to tell her I missed her, to tell her I did not like the feeling hat things were not good between us. Each time I opened my link, I hesitated. I felt so incredibly stupid. I wondered if anything I said or wrote would be the truth. Her words about Star stung. It was over between Star and me, but I still had a great deal of respect for Captain Star Runner. How could I put that part of my life out of mind. Star could, of course. A memory reorganization would put memories of me and our time together far away from Star’s consciousness. Star could look them up, could go into the archives and retrieve everything, but it was not the same as I experienced memory. How could associating myself with the people I met when Star and I were together be such a bad thing. Was Tara Lee so threatened by these people and by Star also? That seemed crazy to me. Tara Lee was at the top of her game, pretty, smart. She had it altogether. Then why,I wondered, did she want anything to do with me? And finally, despite what she had said just before leaving the Elwood Street Diner, why was she not calling me? Did her heart ache for me? Was she reaching for her link just as I was reaching for mine? Or was she going about her business on the Alexandria Space Station as if nothing was amiss. That is how I imagined her, totally compartmentalized, going to meetings, seeing people in her office, solving problems, walking through the station with her confident stride, respected by everyone she met.<a class="headerlink" href="#hat-night-i-activated-my-link-every-twenty-minutes-or-so-to-call-or-text-tara-lee-to-see-how-she-was-doing-to-apologize-for-what-i-did-not-know-to-tell-her-i-was-lonely-to-tell-her-i-missed-her-to-tell-her-i-did-not-like-the-feeling-hat-things-were-not-good-between-us-each-time-i-opened-my-link-i-hesitated-i-felt-so-incredibly-stupid-i-wondered-if-anything-i-said-or-wrote-would-be-the-truth-her-words-about-star-stung-it-was-over-between-star-and-me-but-i-still-had-a-great-deal-of-respect-for-captain-star-runner-how-could-i-put-that-part-of-my-life-out-of-mind-star-could-of-course-a-memory-reorganization-would-put-memories-of-me-and-our-time-together-far-away-from-star-s-consciousness-star-could-look-them-up-could-go-into-the-archives-and-retrieve-everything-but-it-was-not-the-same-as-i-experienced-memory-how-could-associating-myself-with-the-people-i-met-when-star-and-i-were-together-be-such-a-bad-thing-was-tara-lee-so-threatened-by-these-people-and-by-star-also-that-seemed-crazy-to-me-tara-lee-was-at-the-top-of-her-game-pretty-smart-she-had-it-altogether-then-why-i-wondered-did-she-want-anything-to-do-with-me-and-finally-despite-what-she-had-said-just-before-leaving-the-elwood-street-diner-why-was-she-not-calling-me-did-her-heart-ache-for-me-was-she-reaching-for-her-link-just-as-i-was-reaching-for-mine-or-was-she-going-about-her-business-on-the-alexandria-space-station-as-if-nothing-was-amiss-that-is-how-i-imagined-her-totally-compartmentalized-going-to-meetings-seeing-people-in-her-office-solving-problems-walking-through-the-station-with-her-confident-stride-respected-by-everyone-she-met" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>I have a favorite part of the Loop Road which goes around Lake Memphis in the center of Ptolemy City. Much of the lake front is taken up with businesses and the waterfront for boats and swimmers. But here and there the designers of this part of the city created parkland with trees and paths for walkers, runners and cyclists. I walked by the lake’s edge, hearing the gentle slap of the water and smelling the vegetation. My link played soft sounds reminiscent of an earth like forest—or at least that is what the app description said. My link had selected this particular sound track as a soothing accompaniment to my walk. Along with tracking my steps, calories burned and respiration and heartbeat, the link assessed other biological indicators and proposed this sound scape. It reminded me of what Christabel, Star Runner’s artificial intelligence, might do for Star, though Christabel would also be adjusting Star’s body chemistry. Today Cristabel would choose a lot of mood altering chemicals and vitamins along with an energy booster. Star was never alone. Christabel was always in Star’s mind and they kept up a constant chatter between them, sometimes in direct conversation and sometimes more subtly on a thought basis. I was uncomfortable with this at first. It was as if there was a third person always observing us, recording us, making suggestions to Star. After a while though I began to understand how integral a part to Star’s existence Star’s AI is and that sense of a third person faded. It was only when I realized how integrated into the spaceship Star was that I felt alienated and distanced from Star. That was when the bad times happened.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-have-a-favorite-part-of-the-loop-road-which-goes-around-lake-memphis-in-the-center-of-ptolemy-city-much-of-the-lake-front-is-taken-up-with-businesses-and-the-waterfront-for-boats-and-swimmers-but-here-and-there-the-designers-of-this-part-of-the-city-created-parkland-with-trees-and-paths-for-walkers-runners-and-cyclists-i-walked-by-the-lake-s-edge-hearing-the-gentle-slap-of-the-water-and-smelling-the-vegetation-my-link-played-soft-sounds-reminiscent-of-an-earth-like-forest-or-at-least-that-is-what-the-app-description-said-my-link-had-selected-this-particular-sound-track-as-a-soothing-accompaniment-to-my-walk-along-with-tracking-my-steps-calories-burned-and-respiration-and-heartbeat-the-link-assessed-other-biological-indicators-and-proposed-this-sound-scape-it-reminded-me-of-what-christabel-star-runner-s-artificial-intelligence-might-do-for-star-though-christabel-would-also-be-adjusting-star-s-body-chemistry-today-cristabel-would-choose-a-lot-of-mood-altering-chemicals-and-vitamins-along-with-an-energy-booster-star-was-never-alone-christabel-was-always-in-star-s-mind-and-they-kept-up-a-constant-chatter-between-them-sometimes-in-direct-conversation-and-sometimes-more-subtly-on-a-thought-basis-i-was-uncomfortable-with-this-at-first-it-was-as-if-there-was-a-third-person-always-observing-us-recording-us-making-suggestions-to-star-after-a-while-though-i-began-to-understand-how-integral-a-part-to-star-s-existence-star-s-ai-is-and-that-sense-of-a-third-person-faded-it-was-only-when-i-realized-how-integrated-into-the-spaceship-star-was-that-i-felt-alienated-and-distanced-from-star-that-was-when-the-bad-times-happened" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>I did not walk through the great expanse of the Shepheard’s Hotel lobby. Standing in its cavernous space always reminded me of the first time I saw Captain Star Runner, prancing, a long, delicate scarf trailing out behind Star. I remember catching my breath at Star’s magnificence and grace, tail held high and those long legs and shiny fuchsia-colored fur. You could sum it up as animal magnetism but it was the first time I understood the power and sensibility of Pantherans. They walk as if they own the galaxy and as far as the western spiral arm goes, they probably do. Some call it arrogance but when it comes packaged with such an awesome physical presence, it is hard not to be impressed.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-did-not-walk-through-the-great-expanse-of-the-shepheard-s-hotel-lobby-standing-in-its-cavernous-space-always-reminded-me-of-the-first-time-i-saw-captain-star-runner-prancing-a-long-delicate-scarf-trailing-out-behind-star-i-remember-catching-my-breath-at-star-s-magnificence-and-grace-tail-held-high-and-those-long-legs-and-shiny-fuchsia-colored-fur-you-could-sum-it-up-as-animal-magnetism-but-it-was-the-first-time-i-understood-the-power-and-sensibility-of-pantherans-they-walk-as-if-they-own-the-galaxy-and-as-far-as-the-western-spiral-arm-goes-they-probably-do-some-call-it-arrogance-but-when-it-comes-packaged-with-such-an-awesome-physical-presence-it-is-hard-not-to-be-impressed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>I could reach the Terrace Cafe by going along a path lined with luxuriant foliage along one side of the hotel. I stepped onto the terrace which occupies a space between the hotel and the wall of the dome. The dome is transparent. The landscape of Hypatia spreads out before those on the terrace in all its unearthly splendor. Toxic air currents swirl red and yellow patterns against the rock face a quarter mile away. In the distance, volcanoes continually erupt, spewing magma and mist in great plumes into the sky. I paused to watch the show for a few minutes. I was born in Ptolemy City. The view is the only landscape I had ever seen before my one space trip. I can now say I have walked on grass and breathed a planet’s atmosphere. It was a strange and frightening feeling. Standing within the confines of the dome, I felt reassured by its nearness and fascinated yet again by the ever-changing kaleidescope of color before me.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-could-reach-the-terrace-cafe-by-going-along-a-path-lined-with-luxuriant-foliage-along-one-side-of-the-hotel-i-stepped-onto-the-terrace-which-occupies-a-space-between-the-hotel-and-the-wall-of-the-dome-the-dome-is-transparent-the-landscape-of-hypatia-spreads-out-before-those-on-the-terrace-in-all-its-unearthly-splendor-toxic-air-currents-swirl-red-and-yellow-patterns-against-the-rock-face-a-quarter-mile-away-in-the-distance-volcanoes-continually-erupt-spewing-magma-and-mist-in-great-plumes-into-the-sky-i-paused-to-watch-the-show-for-a-few-minutes-i-was-born-in-ptolemy-city-the-view-is-the-only-landscape-i-had-ever-seen-before-my-one-space-trip-i-can-now-say-i-have-walked-on-grass-and-breathed-a-planet-s-atmosphere-it-was-a-strange-and-frightening-feeling-standing-within-the-confines-of-the-dome-i-felt-reassured-by-its-nearness-and-fascinated-yet-again-by-the-ever-changing-kaleidescope-of-color-before-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>After Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo, Captain Star Runner, Tamara and I learned what the Landscape of Thorns was all about, Star brought Tamara and me back to the Pharaoh Star System. Star and I had agreed to break up our relationship. I went back to our villa to get my things and get back on my feet. Star and Gyllian went on to the Northern Frontier. Tamara went with me to the villa and then we went our own ways. I thought Tamara was doing some sightseeing or rest and relaxation here. She had said something about finding the Hypatian landscape breathtaking. I did not think much about her remarks. I was consumed by my own difficult situation and was glad my responsibilities as her host were at an end. I preferred being bad company to myself than trying to be pleasant to Star’s oldest friend. Don’t get me wrong. Tamara is a nice person. It’s just, well, she thinks the galaxy of Star and right then, I was not so inclined to be one of Star’s biggest fans.<a class="headerlink" href="#after-colonel-gyllian-romeres-lujo-captain-star-runner-tamara-and-i-learned-what-the-landscape-of-thorns-was-all-about-star-brought-tamara-and-me-back-to-the-pharaoh-star-system-star-and-i-had-agreed-to-break-up-our-relationship-i-went-back-to-our-villa-to-get-my-things-and-get-back-on-my-feet-star-and-gyllian-went-on-to-the-northern-frontier-tamara-went-with-me-to-the-villa-and-then-we-went-our-own-ways-i-thought-tamara-was-doing-some-sightseeing-or-rest-and-relaxation-here-she-had-said-something-about-finding-the-hypatian-landscape-breathtaking-i-did-not-think-much-about-her-remarks-i-was-consumed-by-my-own-difficult-situation-and-was-glad-my-responsibilities-as-her-host-were-at-an-end-i-preferred-being-bad-company-to-myself-than-trying-to-be-pleasant-to-star-s-oldest-friend-don-t-get-me-wrong-tamara-is-a-nice-person-it-s-just-well-she-thinks-the-galaxy-of-star-and-right-then-i-was-not-so-inclined-to-be-one-of-star-s-biggest-fans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>The contract was fine according to my legal review service. I electronically signed it and returned it to Gyllian. I also had the legal service draw up contracts for Josh, The Czarina and Captain Kidd. They all signed them. On Hypatia, the contract rules. I had their silence and their cooperation. They had their pay and a general outline of their responsibilities. I expected The Czarina and Captain Kidd to continue to be located in Ptolemy City. For the present, they did not have the complete picture as I knew it. They were instructed to listen for any talk about the southern continent, the Alliance of Planets, the Pantherans and Tamara’s name. As general as these parameters were, Josh and I thought this would be sufficient for now until we had a better grasp of the situation on the southern continent.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-contract-was-fine-according-to-my-legal-review-service-i-electronically-signed-it-and-returned-it-to-gyllian-i-also-had-the-legal-service-draw-up-contracts-for-josh-the-czarina-and-captain-kidd-they-all-signed-them-on-hypatia-the-contract-rules-i-had-their-silence-and-their-cooperation-they-had-their-pay-and-a-general-outline-of-their-responsibilities-i-expected-the-czarina-and-captain-kidd-to-continue-to-be-located-in-ptolemy-city-for-the-present-they-did-not-have-the-complete-picture-as-i-knew-it-they-were-instructed-to-listen-for-any-talk-about-the-southern-continent-the-alliance-of-planets-the-pantherans-and-tamara-s-name-as-general-as-these-parameters-were-josh-and-i-thought-this-would-be-sufficient-for-now-until-we-had-a-better-grasp-of-the-situation-on-the-southern-continent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>Many questions remain about the whole investigation. We might never be told what the outcome of Tamara’s investigation was. That was not part of the contract. Nor was I likely to learn what information had been discovered to prompt this investigation. Gyllian’s explanation sounds very weak to me. Her fear of Pantheran reprisal sounds quite plausible to me. More and more I am seeing how manipulative and self-interested the Pantherans are. They are certainly not a benevolent force in the Coalition. I remember the first time I heard Star refer to the Pantheran dominance in the Coalition as the Pantheran Empire. Despite Star’s lack of standing in the Pantheran sphere of influence and their antipathy toward Star, Star seemed quite proud of The Race and their superior position in the western spiral arm. I needed to keep that Pantheran arrogance in mind. I had seen at the Landscape of Thorns their willingness to sweep in with warships.<a class="headerlink" href="#many-questions-remain-about-the-whole-investigation-we-might-never-be-told-what-the-outcome-of-tamara-s-investigation-was-that-was-not-part-of-the-contract-nor-was-i-likely-to-learn-what-information-had-been-discovered-to-prompt-this-investigation-gyllian-s-explanation-sounds-very-weak-to-me-her-fear-of-pantheran-reprisal-sounds-quite-plausible-to-me-more-and-more-i-am-seeing-how-manipulative-and-self-interested-the-pantherans-are-they-are-certainly-not-a-benevolent-force-in-the-coalition-i-remember-the-first-time-i-heard-star-refer-to-the-pantheran-dominance-in-the-coalition-as-the-pantheran-empire-despite-star-s-lack-of-standing-in-the-pantheran-sphere-of-influence-and-their-antipathy-toward-star-star-seemed-quite-proud-of-the-race-and-their-superior-position-in-the-western-spiral-arm-i-needed-to-keep-that-pantheran-arrogance-in-mind-i-had-seen-at-the-landscape-of-thorns-their-willingness-to-sweep-in-with-warships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>We traveled by caravan to the spaceport. I had arranged for the training vehicle–Star always called fliers and spacecraft either vehicles or rides–prepared for our departure. It was waiting for us on one of the fields. Star would have called it a ride park. I wished I could stop thinking in these terms. But it was, after all, Star’s property. I was still listed as someone who could use the flier or designate someone else to use it. That had been thoughtful of Star.

<h1>It is not required for anyone to file a flight plan when leaving the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport. Of course you can file one if you want to.

It is more likely that you do not want your travel to be traced.

<h1>I had been to the southern continent before. Our villa was located near the southern pole. I knew Star sold the villa but I did not know to whom. As I reviewed our flight plan on the display in front of me, I saw we were going to be setting down within a few hundred miles of the villa. The good news was that we were relatively far away from the ring of volcanoes which circled Hypatia along the fortieth parallel south. The bad news was that Hypatia was extremely cold at this latitude indicated for the dig. That meant we could not sped any time outdoors even in our environmental suits. They were rated for the Hypatian cold, but only that around Ptolemy City which was in a very temperate zone–temperate as far as Hypatia was concerned.

<h1>I wondered uneasily if we would return to the subject. The thought of Pantheran warships firing on Hypatia made me very queasy indeed. I did not think the Rich and Famous and the League of Hypatian Pirates would take well to eventuality. I wondered if they would have a response. It certainly might dissuade the tourist trade from being so brisk. People might find other places to conduct business and Ptolemy City would fall on hard times. If it was no longer profitable, the whole city and the Alexandria Space Station could fold. Thinking of the space station prompted me to think of Tara Lee. What would she say about this? How much had she guessed. Was her outburst more driven by fear than personal promise with me?

<h1>The first expansion into space was hampered by time and distance. Spaceships could only travel at sub light speeds. This meant that humanity could only hope to colonize other planets and asteroids in the home system. Although science fiction had always proposed colonists would be in cryogenic sleep, the medical and scientific communities never developed this technology. Alternatively, writers had imagined generational ships. These, by design, would have to be all things to all people. That design never got off the ground literally or figuratively. The flights had to be short enough that extensive governmental systems were unnecessary. Although hes were necessary when the people reached their new home, they still were in close enough radio contact that they could consult with colleagues back on Earth to resolve any major issues. These colonies grew but the available technology was just not available. Sustaining colonies on the Moon, Mars, and moons of some of the outer planets and a few asteroids proved possible but not necessarily attractive. Mostly they were mining operations with the workers and their families rotating in and out. This was costly but the results of their mining efforts were worth it.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-expansion-into-space-was-hampered-by-time-and-distance-spaceships-could-only-travel-at-sub-light-speeds-this-meant-that-humanity-could-only-hope-to-colonize-other-planets-and-asteroids-in-the-home-system-although-science-fiction-had-always-proposed-colonists-would-be-in-cryogenic-sleep-the-medical-and-scientific-communities-never-developed-this-technology-alternatively-writers-had-imagined-generational-ships-these-by-design-would-have-to-be-all-things-to-all-people-that-design-never-got-off-the-ground-literally-or-figuratively-the-flights-had-to-be-short-enough-that-extensive-governmental-systems-were-unnecessary-although-hes-were-necessary-when-the-people-reached-their-new-home-they-still-were-in-close-enough-radio-contact-that-they-could-consult-with-colleagues-back-on-earth-to-resolve-any-major-issues-these-colonies-grew-but-the-available-technology-was-just-not-available-sustaining-colonies-on-the-moon-mars-and-moons-of-some-of-the-outer-planets-and-a-few-asteroids-proved-possible-but-not-necessarily-attractive-mostly-they-were-mining-operations-with-the-workers-and-their-families-rotating-in-and-out-this-was-costly-but-the-results-of-their-mining-efforts-were-worth-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>I put together a basic supply list for the villa including the supplies Tamara had asked for. By their isolation, villas often have great amounts of food stored in them so it would be a long time before anyone questioned it. The chatter The Czarina was liable to hear was that I was opening the villa back up again. There might be speculation about Star’s return or our getting back together again. I wondered if Tara Lee would hear this and how it would affect her silence. I kept checking for messages but none came. I felt awful about this but I could not yet imagine what I could say or do to repair the breech. I was not ready to commit myself to Tara Lee to the exclusion of others forever and ever. I wondered if finding another girl friend would let me know if I was serious about Tara Lee. That sounded would very unfair to the other woman so I dismissed it from my mind.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-put-together-a-basic-supply-list-for-the-villa-including-the-supplies-tamara-had-asked-for-by-their-isolation-villas-often-have-great-amounts-of-food-stored-in-them-so-it-would-be-a-long-time-before-anyone-questioned-it-the-chatter-the-czarina-was-liable-to-hear-was-that-i-was-opening-the-villa-back-up-again-there-might-be-speculation-about-star-s-return-or-our-getting-back-together-again-i-wondered-if-tara-lee-would-hear-this-and-how-it-would-affect-her-silence-i-kept-checking-for-messages-but-none-came-i-felt-awful-about-this-but-i-could-not-yet-imagine-what-i-could-say-or-do-to-repair-the-breech-i-was-not-ready-to-commit-myself-to-tara-lee-to-the-exclusion-of-others-forever-and-ever-i-wondered-if-finding-another-girl-friend-would-let-me-know-if-i-was-serious-about-tara-lee-that-sounded-would-very-unfair-to-the-other-woman-so-i-dismissed-it-from-my-mind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>Even if Star returned to the Pharaoh Star System, I imagined Star and I could share this villa and not both be here at the same time. That gave me an opportunity to picture Tara Lee and myself here. Would she like it? Could I imagine the two of us curled up on the floor before this fire, the many brightly colored cushions piled up against our backs or strewn across the floor as an elaborate mattress? I remembered the wild ride in the flier here. I remembered many days spent with Star–the beauty of the wild landscape outside and the exotic lovemaking inside. Star was full of surprises. That day I particularly remembered the softness of Star’s fur and the deep rumble of Star’s purr. Going to all of Ptolemy City’s hot spots with Tara Lee was exciting. Coming back to my coop for intense sex was something which could get my heart beating and my body pulsing. But a snowy afternoon with Star before this fire was a very special memory. Could Tara Lee leave the pulsing music and elegant restaurants of Ptolemy City behind for a retreat to this villa? I did not know. We never tried it. Just picturing her in her Lacey lingerie lounging on these pillows caused me to become aroused. I missed her. I missed her laughter. I missed watching her do her nails.

Star could not access them. I instructed Christabel to delete the conversations if Star got pushy. Star never did so they must still be a part of that AI’s database.

No other significant finds occurred. The team cleared more and more tunnels. They seemed to go on for ever and ever. Scans of the area were inconclusive.

They were entrenched on Cleopatra, depending primarily on the League of Hypatian Pirates for their supplies. And the Coalition needed the antonium from the mines on Mark <a class="reference external" href="http://Antony.In">Antony.In</a> my humble opinion, and not being up-to-speed on all the political and financial ramifications, I figured this kept us pretty safe from Coalition, meaning Pantheran, interference.

<h1>“Things inside the Coalition are quite tense,” Emily Dickinson said. “The Pantherans keep having reasons to have a greater military presence and less autonomy by the races inside the Coalition. Their spy networks are so good it is difficult for any organized resistance to their activity to be effective. The Solar League has appealed to the Consortium for help. The planets on the Southern Frontier are not organized so they cannot be of much held. Mostly those planets are either agricultural or held by families like on Fair Haven. The Consortium can do a few things–I’m not at liberty to say anything about what they are doing and I don’t know a lot anyway–but this operation on Hypatia seemed worth pursuing. It might just give us a way to work around the Pantherans.”<a class="headerlink" href="#things-inside-the-coalition-are-quite-tense-emily-dickinson-said-the-pantherans-keep-having-reasons-to-have-a-greater-military-presence-and-less-autonomy-by-the-races-inside-the-coalition-their-spy-networks-are-so-good-it-is-difficult-for-any-organized-resistance-to-their-activity-to-be-effective-the-solar-league-has-appealed-to-the-consortium-for-help-the-planets-on-the-southern-frontier-are-not-organized-so-they-cannot-be-of-much-held-mostly-those-planets-are-either-agricultural-or-held-by-families-like-on-fair-haven-the-consortium-can-do-a-few-things-i-m-not-at-liberty-to-say-anything-about-what-they-are-doing-and-i-don-t-know-a-lot-anyway-but-this-operation-on-hypatia-seemed-worth-pursuing-it-might-just-give-us-a-way-to-work-around-the-pantherans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>It took us some time to walk there. The villa looked small on the outside but it was extremely extensive on the inside. The room we had first entered was a reception area. It could serve as a convenient living area. A kitchen was nearby. But when we went farther, we discovered this area was just to let people think it was a small villa. There were much more lavish areas underground–rooms and rooms. I had been to Adam Worth’s official residence. It was large, gaudy and filled with expensive furnishings and artwork. This villa seemed to be furnished with equally expensive items and a larger collection of artwork. I wondered if anyone else knew of it. It could fund Tamara’s operation all by itself and it was here for the taking. There was no claim on this villa. I checked while I walked. There would be no harm in putting a claim in, I thought, so I did. I had the financial resources to even put a claim of formal ownership. As I reached the cavern where a number of fliers were parked, the registration office back in Ptolemy City accepted my claim and deducted the funds from my account.<a class="headerlink" href="#it-took-us-some-time-to-walk-there-the-villa-looked-small-on-the-outside-but-it-was-extremely-extensive-on-the-inside-the-room-we-had-first-entered-was-a-reception-area-it-could-serve-as-a-convenient-living-area-a-kitchen-was-nearby-but-when-we-went-farther-we-discovered-this-area-was-just-to-let-people-think-it-was-a-small-villa-there-were-much-more-lavish-areas-underground-rooms-and-rooms-i-had-been-to-adam-worth-s-official-residence-it-was-large-gaudy-and-filled-with-expensive-furnishings-and-artwork-this-villa-seemed-to-be-furnished-with-equally-expensive-items-and-a-larger-collection-of-artwork-i-wondered-if-anyone-else-knew-of-it-it-could-fund-tamara-s-operation-all-by-itself-and-it-was-here-for-the-taking-there-was-no-claim-on-this-villa-i-checked-while-i-walked-there-would-be-no-harm-in-putting-a-claim-in-i-thought-so-i-did-i-had-the-financial-resources-to-even-put-a-claim-of-formal-ownership-as-i-reached-the-cavern-where-a-number-of-fliers-were-parked-the-registration-office-back-in-ptolemy-city-accepted-my-claim-and-deducted-the-funds-from-my-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>There was clothing and other personal items. I set them aside. There was her cred-pack. I put those in my bag. Among her identification information were tickets for a shuttle and passage back to the Solar League via Three Ravens. I could cash them in on Alexandria Space Station. They were not part of her personal profile but were stand-alone items which could not be traced to her. Perhaps the Solar League Examiner had paid for them. Perhaps the Pantherans had paid for them. In either case, they did not want any record of the transaction on file. As a result, I could cash them in and would. This job was turning out to be very different from what Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo had represented it to be. I would need to pay my people regardless of how things ended between Gyllian and me. These tickets would do just that.<a class="headerlink" href="#there-was-clothing-and-other-personal-items-i-set-them-aside-there-was-her-cred-pack-i-put-those-in-my-bag-among-her-identification-information-were-tickets-for-a-shuttle-and-passage-back-to-the-solar-league-via-three-ravens-i-could-cash-them-in-on-alexandria-space-station-they-were-not-part-of-her-personal-profile-but-were-stand-alone-items-which-could-not-be-traced-to-her-perhaps-the-solar-league-examiner-had-paid-for-them-perhaps-the-pantherans-had-paid-for-them-in-either-case-they-did-not-want-any-record-of-the-transaction-on-file-as-a-result-i-could-cash-them-in-and-would-this-job-was-turning-out-to-be-very-different-from-what-colonel-gyllian-romeres-lujo-had-represented-it-to-be-i-would-need-to-pay-my-people-regardless-of-how-things-ended-between-gyllian-and-me-these-tickets-would-do-just-that" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>The flight through the ring of volcanoes was tense. The base flier strained to get through the pass. Thankfully, it had enough power to make it to the base. If it had not enough power, Josh and I would have been stranded and would have died. Neither of us had considered the possibilities. We needed to check on power and radio contact abilities. We were learning the hard way how to survive on this hostile planet of ours. We were creatures of the dome around Ptolemy City. Although I had been in space for a much longer time than Josh had, I had been in the care of an experienced star runner. I found spaceships confining and space travel filled with unrelenting boredom, but I did not experience the fear of not getting to our destination. Star’s confidence and competence permeated Star’s ship and I never doubted Star’s ability to get us to where we were going safely. I now had an inkling of what that took and Star made it look easy.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-flight-through-the-ring-of-volcanoes-was-tense-the-base-flier-strained-to-get-through-the-pass-thankfully-it-had-enough-power-to-make-it-to-the-base-if-it-had-not-enough-power-josh-and-i-would-have-been-stranded-and-would-have-died-neither-of-us-had-considered-the-possibilities-we-needed-to-check-on-power-and-radio-contact-abilities-we-were-learning-the-hard-way-how-to-survive-on-this-hostile-planet-of-ours-we-were-creatures-of-the-dome-around-ptolemy-city-although-i-had-been-in-space-for-a-much-longer-time-than-josh-had-i-had-been-in-the-care-of-an-experienced-star-runner-i-found-spaceships-confining-and-space-travel-filled-with-unrelenting-boredom-but-i-did-not-experience-the-fear-of-not-getting-to-our-destination-star-s-confidence-and-competence-permeated-star-s-ship-and-i-never-doubted-star-s-ability-to-get-us-to-where-we-were-going-safely-i-now-had-an-inkling-of-what-that-took-and-star-made-it-look-easy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

One day a star runner docked at our station and ate at the diner where I worked. We talked. Star was so naive about everything human. It was like educating a little kid but Star was all grown up. I found I could pour out my troubles to Star and Star would listen. Star never forgot, never did not listen. My dream was to go to University. There was money to send me but no way to get me there. Star took me. Prudence Wu made Star my legal guardian which was weird, but Star made all the necessary arrangements for me to enroll at the University of the Gifted Mind and stay there.

It seems to me they might want to re-establish their empire, but they need people like us to lord it over. I like living on the Northern Frontier and I like being free of all their restrictions. But what I learn from archeology is that there are always forces stronger than you out there in the universe, in the western spiral arm if you want to make it specific to our situation.

Pirates have treasure and they do pray on the weak and the defenseless. But pirates are more than common criminals–at least some of us are. There are thugs, of course.” Captain Kidd glanced in The Czarina’s direction.

<h1>It looks like I have some time line issues.

Star finds Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo involved with Lester, a Professor at the University of the Gifted Mind. Emily Dickinson has gone to the Southern Frontier and has not been heard of since. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo encourages Star to contact Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Star does. Ronnie invites Star to come to the Pharaoh Star System. Star reunites with Ronnie at the Intergalactic Diner. Meanwhile, there are ongoing insurrections within the Coalition and Star does not think the Pantherans will use excessive force because they do not want to show their hand and their much superior military force.<a class="headerlink" href="#it-looks-like-i-have-some-time-line-issues-in-sanctuary-my-2010-nanowrimo-novel-for-captain-star-runner-star-returns-to-the-western-spiral-arm-four-years-after-breaking-up-with-detective-ronnie-camberwell-star-finds-colonel-gyllian-romeres-lujo-involved-with-lester-a-professor-at-the-university-of-the-gifted-mind-emily-dickinson-has-gone-to-the-southern-frontier-and-has-not-been-heard-of-since-captain-gyllian-romeres-lujo-encourages-star-to-contact-detective-ronnie-camberwell-and-star-does-ronnie-invites-star-to-come-to-the-pharaoh-star-system-star-reunites-with-ronnie-at-the-intergalactic-diner-meanwhile-there-are-ongoing-insurrections-within-the-coalition-and-star-does-not-think-the-pantherans-will-use-excessive-force-because-they-do-not-want-to-show-their-hand-and-their-much-superior-military-force" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>Tara Lee was walking casually dressed in her security chief uniform. She was looking around. She called it managing by walking around. She got a feel for the station, what was going on, and what her people were up to. She could sit at her desk and review all the monitors. She often did. But Tara Lee also got out and made herself known. Her people never knew when they would find her looking over their shoulders. If they were doing their jobs, all well and good. But if they were not, there would be trouble. Tara Lee was very unforgiving on the job. I wondered how unforgiving she was in her personal life.<a class="headerlink" href="#tara-lee-was-walking-casually-dressed-in-her-security-chief-uniform-she-was-looking-around-she-called-it-managing-by-walking-around-she-got-a-feel-for-the-station-what-was-going-on-and-what-her-people-were-up-to-she-could-sit-at-her-desk-and-review-all-the-monitors-she-often-did-but-tara-lee-also-got-out-and-made-herself-known-her-people-never-knew-when-they-would-find-her-looking-over-their-shoulders-if-they-were-doing-their-jobs-all-well-and-good-but-if-they-were-not-there-would-be-trouble-tara-lee-was-very-unforgiving-on-the-job-i-wondered-how-unforgiving-she-was-in-her-personal-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>My flying lessons from the training flier continued. On the one hand, the flier was able to give me both verbal instructions and display helpful diagrams on the screen in front of my seat. On the other hand, it was curt in its corrections of my errors and slowness to respond. I gathered coddling its trainees, encouragement and a sense of humor were totally absent when training potential star runners. The lack of any personal connection unnerved me. All the AIs I had ever interacted with except perhaps very basic ones in a caravan had some humor and warmth programmed in. They could repeat the same instruction over and over again without sounding irritated or condescending. This was not true of the flier’s AI. I was definitely at the bottom of my class and probably the slowest and the stupidest trainee it had ever had. But then again, I was not genetically designed and engineered to fly a craft. Nevertheless, I persisted. That wild ride with Star piloting back in the day has always stuck with me. We survived not because the AI knew what to do but because Star knew how to get as much as possible out of the flier. Star used the AI but also brought Star’s own experience and skill to bear.

It would arrive in a timely fashion, negotiate docking, wait for Tara Lee and bring her safely to the villa. I recorded a message to this affect, leaving out the part about Captain Star Runner, of course. If the flier volunteered this information, so be it. If Tara Lee guessed, so be it.

<h1>The personal flier that Josh and I brought from the villa–it definitely needed a name–received the supplies I ordered as soon as I climbed aboard the shuttle craft. Josh confirmed the house AI reported an ample stock of food stuffs and other household items. I had perishable goods brought in. The hydroponic tanks were empty. I would have to work out how to revitalize them. In the meantime, we could run over to Star’s villa. Those tanks were now operational. I made sure items Tara Lee liked were available and laid in some special items for our enjoyment. Finally, I launched several coded searches on the political situation inside and outside the Coalition. I also did a deep background check on Gyllian. It felt invasive but I needed to know.

<h1>As far as we could tell, no word of the Big Dig had slipped out. This did not mean it had not. It only meant we did not know about it. Denise Kahlil’s presence on Hypatia was troubling and her connection to the Pantheran General Secretary’s office (Note to self: flesh this out a bit more. I said she was passing information to the Pantherans but I need to be more specific. The General Secretary is the executive of the Coalition. The General Secretary works with the Assembly of the Races which passes legislation for the General Secretary to put into practice, or not, as the General Secretary see fit. The General Secretary is always an ungendered Pantheran whose appointment is confirmed by the Assembly of the Races. No assembly has ever refused to confirm a Pantheran appointee. In addition, it is important to mention that the Pantherans do not send any representatives to the Assembly of the Races. They are not equal partners. Their role is clearly that of caretaker and benevolent overlord. In practice, the Coalition is more feudal than democratic while pretending to be the latter.)<a class="headerlink" href="#as-far-as-we-could-tell-no-word-of-the-big-dig-had-slipped-out-this-did-not-mean-it-had-not-it-only-meant-we-did-not-know-about-it-denise-kahlil-s-presence-on-hypatia-was-troubling-and-her-connection-to-the-pantheran-general-secretary-s-office-note-to-self-flesh-this-out-a-bit-more-i-said-she-was-passing-information-to-the-pantherans-but-i-need-to-be-more-specific-the-general-secretary-is-the-executive-of-the-coalition-the-general-secretary-works-with-the-assembly-of-the-races-which-passes-legislation-for-the-general-secretary-to-put-into-practice-or-not-as-the-general-secretary-see-fit-the-general-secretary-is-always-an-ungendered-pantheran-whose-appointment-is-confirmed-by-the-assembly-of-the-races-no-assembly-has-ever-refused-to-confirm-a-pantheran-appointee-in-addition-it-is-important-to-mention-that-the-pantherans-do-not-send-any-representatives-to-the-assembly-of-the-races-they-are-not-equal-partners-their-role-is-clearly-that-of-caretaker-and-benevolent-overlord-in-practice-the-coalition-is-more-feudal-than-democratic-while-pretending-to-be-the-latter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

Whole planets would starve or go back to a a commercial and industrial system which could no longer depend on space flight and the interchange between planets and races.

<h1>Reasonable was not a proper adjective. Over the top might be a better one–deep plush carpets, thick draperies, mirrors, mirrors, mirrors!

I had never made up my mind if this meant she was inventive, well-schooled on videos or well-traveled. I never asked. A smile came to my face looking at the pool of bubbling water.

<h1>I remembered that was Star’s first adventure. I looked at the date. Star and Gyllian went back a long way. Not as far as Gyllian and Emily Dickinson, but more than twelve years. I had still be in high school. Then again, that made Star only about fifteen or sixteen years old. I remembered Star had no idea how long a star runner lived. The older ones were always terminated.

<h1>For some time, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo has been crusading for the Consortium of Planets, in cooperation with the Solar League, to be skeptical of Coalition claims of neutrality toward the non-Pantheran races. She maintains that the Pantheran agenda is to subjugate the other races and establish its hegemony in the western spiral arm. Her activities, although widely supported by the Consortium of Planets upper echelons privately, is problematic for its public image of wanting to cooperate with the Coalition to reopen borders between the Coalition and the Northern Frontier. More advanced planets are trying to develop a closer relationship with their counterparts in the Solar League and like-minded planets of other races. Her biggest support comes from more frontier planets deeper inside the northern territory. Her dismissal from the Ministry of Defense is seen as a victory for the moderates and a setback to the ore radical elements. Some documents suggest, however, that highly positioned people in the government agree with her and this dismissal is only a public relations move. Colonel Gyllian Romeres may still be employed by the Intelligence Branch and is working undercover in plain sight.<a class="headerlink" href="#for-some-time-colonel-gyllian-romeres-lujo-has-been-crusading-for-the-consortium-of-planets-in-cooperation-with-the-solar-league-to-be-skeptical-of-coalition-claims-of-neutrality-toward-the-non-pantheran-races-she-maintains-that-the-pantheran-agenda-is-to-subjugate-the-other-races-and-establish-its-hegemony-in-the-western-spiral-arm-her-activities-although-widely-supported-by-the-consortium-of-planets-upper-echelons-privately-is-problematic-for-its-public-image-of-wanting-to-cooperate-with-the-coalition-to-reopen-borders-between-the-coalition-and-the-northern-frontier-more-advanced-planets-are-trying-to-develop-a-closer-relationship-with-their-counterparts-in-the-solar-league-and-like-minded-planets-of-other-races-her-biggest-support-comes-from-more-frontier-planets-deeper-inside-the-northern-territory-her-dismissal-from-the-ministry-of-defense-is-seen-as-a-victory-for-the-moderates-and-a-setback-to-the-ore-radical-elements-some-documents-suggest-however-that-highly-positioned-people-in-the-government-agree-with-her-and-this-dismissal-is-only-a-public-relations-move-colonel-gyllian-romeres-may-still-be-employed-by-the-intelligence-branch-and-is-working-undercover-in-plain-sight" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>“Pantheran,” I said, “specifically, star runner Pantheran. That flier was once a star runner training ride. It was re purposed and given to a Pantheran agent known on Hypatia at Richard III, Duke of the Gloucester Road. It was outfitted to be used by a human being–the displays and verbal inputs and outputs. On a very wild run–which I won’t go into–Captain Star Runner discovered it was of Pantheran design and re-established its star runner interface. The two of them discovered the flier had been Star’s trainer. They got on famously. Star claimed the flier and made more human adaptations so I could fly it–I use that word loosely. I still have access to the flier. I keep it because it can fly with the Pharaoh Star System. So, I could use it to fetch you here directly–no going to the Faros Lighthouse Spaceport, no renting a flier, no going from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere and halfway around the planet.

Although I had not really thought about it critically, I did not think anyone else could make me this happy and at peace. But in that moment of feeling the tip of her finger touch me in that way, I thought of Star’s tongue doing the same thing and how much I wanted her finger to be rough and warm and moist the way Star’s tongue was. She did not have whiskers to rub against me there or the gentle prick of sharp teeth or the wideness of a Pantheran’s mouth to kiss me.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-had-been-so-happy-with-tara-lee-i-had-lived-in-the-moment-enjoying-her-being-satisfied-with-her-wanting-these-moments-to-last-a-lifetime-i-felt-at-home-in-my-body-and-at-home-with-hers-although-i-had-not-really-thought-about-it-critically-i-did-not-think-anyone-else-could-make-me-this-happy-and-at-peace-but-in-that-moment-of-feeling-the-tip-of-her-finger-touch-me-in-that-way-i-thought-of-star-s-tongue-doing-the-same-thing-and-how-much-i-wanted-her-finger-to-be-rough-and-warm-and-moist-the-way-star-s-tongue-was-she-did-not-have-whiskers-to-rub-against-me-there-or-the-gentle-prick-of-sharp-teeth-or-the-wideness-of-a-pantheran-s-mouth-to-kiss-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>“No,” Christabel said. “This may sound indelicate, but you do not have Star’s undivided attention. It may seem possible to send a ride on a trajectory through Mother Space and have it get to where it is going. That is what your star ships do because there is a lot of information about their hyperspace travel available. That is not the case here. We are in a slightly different fold of space then we used previously. Star is mapping it and deciding if we are truly on course. It is what a star runner does. Because this territory is new, it requires concentration. Star does not need to give its undivided attention to monitoring. I can do a lot of it myself, but Star does need to sample Mother Space regularly.

<h1>Star, speaking as the captain, explained we were approaching our extraction point. Star would need to approach it slowly and examine it carefully. Star had not done an in depth study of the jump gate on Star’s last visit here. What Star could tell us was that the jump gate was very old and different from any jump gate Star had ever seen or studied. It was even different, though similar to, the jump gate we had used in the Pharaoh Star System. Star assured everyone that would not be trapped in hyperspace. There were nearby extraction points. We did not want to use these because nearby extraction points in hyperspace were not nearby in normal space. Star had also noted many extraction points en route we could use if necessary. Star also reminded us that Star had the most up-to-date star charts available.<a class="headerlink" href="#star-speaking-as-the-captain-explained-we-were-approaching-our-extraction-point-star-would-need-to-approach-it-slowly-and-examine-it-carefully-star-had-not-done-an-in-depth-study-of-the-jump-gate-on-star-s-last-visit-here-what-star-could-tell-us-was-that-the-jump-gate-was-very-old-and-different-from-any-jump-gate-star-had-ever-seen-or-studied-it-was-even-different-though-similar-to-the-jump-gate-we-had-used-in-the-pharaoh-star-system-star-assured-everyone-that-would-not-be-trapped-in-hyperspace-there-were-nearby-extraction-points-we-did-not-want-to-use-these-because-nearby-extraction-points-in-hyperspace-were-not-nearby-in-normal-space-star-had-also-noted-many-extraction-points-en-route-we-could-use-if-necessary-star-also-reminded-us-that-star-had-the-most-up-to-date-star-charts-available" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>The Confederates as they liked to be called were very suspicious of Captain Star Runner at first. Star provided copies of Star’s adventures, both published and unpublished. This helped. Star made a survey of the star systems of the Confederacy of Planets and located a position for a jump gate. It surprised us all that the Confederates could construct one. Star provided hyperspace navigation as well. Knowing Captain Star Runner, these services were not free, but knowing Gyllian, an arrangement was made. After their initial shock, the archaeological expedition settled in for an in-depth study. The Czarina and Captain Kidd stayed, too. Captain Kidd represented the League of Hypatian Pirates and went into negotiations. The Czarina saw an opportunity to ingratiate herself into many potential sources for information.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-confederates-as-they-liked-to-be-called-were-very-suspicious-of-captain-star-runner-at-first-star-provided-copies-of-star-s-adventures-both-published-and-unpublished-this-helped-star-made-a-survey-of-the-star-systems-of-the-confederacy-of-planets-and-located-a-position-for-a-jump-gate-it-surprised-us-all-that-the-confederates-could-construct-one-star-provided-hyperspace-navigation-as-well-knowing-captain-star-runner-these-services-were-not-free-but-knowing-gyllian-an-arrangement-was-made-after-their-initial-shock-the-archaeological-expedition-settled-in-for-an-in-depth-study-the-czarina-and-captain-kidd-stayed-too-captain-kidd-represented-the-league-of-hypatian-pirates-and-went-into-negotiations-the-czarina-saw-an-opportunity-to-ingratiate-herself-into-many-potential-sources-for-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h1>What we learned in the Confederacy would be highly confidential for some time. The implications of putting the Confederacy on the western galactic arm’s map needed to be considered.

Their first task was to study the effect on relations with the Pantherans.
