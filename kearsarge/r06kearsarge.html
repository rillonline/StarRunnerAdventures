<h1>I Talk with Josh<a class="headerlink" href="#i-talk-with-josh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I remembered a boy with spiky hair and a love of anything technical. The
hair cut was trendy. The clothes were casual but neat. Josh Hardy
stilled loved his technology. He had hacked everything for as long as I
can remember.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ronnie,” he said when he met me in his reception area. “Come on
back.”</p>
<p>We entered an office which looked nothing like an office. Screens,
keyboards, cables and boxes, the nature of which I could not guess, were
everywhere.</p>
<p>“I’m still the same old Josh.” His smile was self-deprecating.</p>
<p>“People still use keyboards?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure. They’re easy and quite secure. If you speak, people can hear
you.”</p>
<p>“You can’t use thoughts?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We’re not the big cats,” Josh said, “but I guess you know all about
them. I hear you married one.”</p>
<p>“No, it was a legal partnership,” I said, and left it at that. Maybe someday I would tell Josh about
that time in my life but now was not that time.</p>
<p>Josh sighed. “Personal relationships were never my forte.” Then, always
vivacious, he said, “I’m good at technical things and that’s why you’re
here.”</p>
<p>“These messages were sent,” I began.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking at them.” josh broke in. “You’re working for
Kearsarge. That’s cool. She’s really hot.”</p>
<p>“Hot?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You know, sexy, very cool.”</p>
<p>I really had been out of touch.</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. “The messages.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, they’re creepy.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m investigating.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, sure. Well, anyway, I can trace them for a little while and
then I run into a wall.”</p>
<p>“You run into a wall,” I prompted. My interview techniques were being
sorely tested.</p>
<p>“Ah, Ronnie, you know messages are passed through the communications
net.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“I can follow them all around the star system,” Josh said. “They took
quite a circuitous route, probably to discourage trackers. I’m good,
Ronnie. I can follow a trail like this. But then I can’t trace it any
farther. It came from outside, but I can’t figure out where. I can keep
on working on it, trying to crack the blocker, but you said it was
urgent.”</p>
<p>Josh was crestfallen. Jamming Josh is the best legitimate hacker on
Hypatia.</p>
<p>“What do the pirates have to say?” I asked. I expected him to deny he
had sources within the League of Hypatian Pirates.</p>
<p>“I talked with them,” Josh admitted. “They’re just as puzzled as I am.
And that ticks them off. They don’t like to be unable to eavesdrop on
someone else’s conversation. They’ll crack it. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“By then it won’t matter,” I said. I felt defeated.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Josh asked.</p>
<p>“These are death threats, Josh,” I said. “I want to stop this guy. I
haven’t a clue who he might be.”</p>
<p>“And the marathon is tomorrow,” Josh said. “Do you think anything will
happen during the race?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” I said. “Kearsarge won’t withdraw or even consider
protection.”</p>
<p>“That’s weird,” Josh said.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me,” I said. “Who else can I try?”</p>
<p>“Ronnie,” Josh chided, “I’m the best on Hypatia.”</p>
<p>“Then where else can I go?” I repeated.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s always the Fungusians,” Josh said, “I hear they’re the
best hackers in the known galaxy.” He laughed. “Not that anyone knows
how to reach them.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to say, “Captain Star Runner does,” but I caught
myself in time. Star was gone. They couldn’t put me in touch.</p>
<p>And then I remembered. My link was designed by the Fungusian Network.
Was it also designed with contact information?</p>
<p>“Let me try something,” I said.</p>
<p>I touched the flower on my wrist. Admittedly this was a large gesture,
not at all subtle. Josh was surprised.</p>
<p>I said aloud, “Contact the Fungusian Network.”</p>
<p>My visual display prompted, “Message…”</p>
<p>“Tell them to contact Josh Hardy because I need to trace some messages
whose origins are outside the Pharaoh Star System. Conventional hacking
is ineffective.”</p>
<p>I sent it.</p>
<p>“You’re wet wired?” Josh was incredulous.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I’m not good with the technology.”</p>
<p>“And did you really send a message to the Fungusian Network?” Josh
asked.</p>
<p>“I think so,” I said. “They designed the system so I figured they’d
have some sort of contact info built in.”</p>
<p>“And they’ll know who I am?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if Josh was still incredulous or pleased that the
Fungusians would know who he was.</p>
<p>“I’m sure your contact info was attached,” I said. “I think this sort
of link has a micro AI built in.”</p>
<p>“It would have to,” Josh said, returning to the tech guy he was.</p>
<p>Wearily, I got to my feet. I could do nothing about the mesages until
the Fungusians got back to us–if the Fungusians got back to us.</p>
<p>“Thanks for your help,” I said to Josh.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Josh protested.</p>
<p>“But you’ll send me a bill just the same,” I said.</p>
<p>Josh’s goofy grin returned. “Of course, I will. I have to pay for all
this stuff, Ronnie” He waved his hand around the lab.</p>
<p>As I reached the door Josh said, “You wouldn’t want to go out to dinner
or something, would you?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I’m still not interested in guys in that way.”</p>
<p>“Just thought I’d ask.”</p>
<p>“No harm done,” I said.</p>
<p>Josh and I go a way back and he always wanted to date me. I never wanted
to date him. He is not my type. At this point, I did not want to date
anyone. I felt that no woman could interest me much less a man. Star
Runner, with all flaws, was tough to match.</p>
<p>“”But it didn’t work,” I reminded myself. Star is a creature of space,
uncomfortable planet side. And I would be happy if I never left Hypatia
again.</p>
<p>“Let me know if you hear anything,” I said, “or learn anything.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
